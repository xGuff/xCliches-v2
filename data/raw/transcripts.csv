Liverpool,2025/26,Arne Slot,6Pntjzqgn-w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pntjzqgn-w,2025-08-29,"I'd imagine you're probably expecting this and without naming names, but with Newcastle looking like they're getting a striker in, what impact does that potentially have on your own chance of adding to your squad? Then in general terms anyway, how likely do you feel you are now to add further signings to your squad before that deadline? Uh, before I answer that question, I have to ask you from Pats because I just had an interview with him what you had for breakfast this morning. It was a donut that I It was a donut that I kept from uh a game I was at the other night. That was all I was working as a reporter at that point. Yeah. So, you came into the Liverpool building with the donut. Yeah. Where the donut from? Uh from another football. Okay. Very nice. By the way, you should try them. Yeah. It's too many calories. Not Not Yeah, not the most healthy. I was in a rush this morning. I woke up late. So, yeah. um Newcastle signed if it's true. Uh and I have no reason not to believe what you are saying a new number nine. So that's very nice for Eddie because uh Anthony Cordon is suspended and um and Isak is not has not been training with the team a lot. So it's nice for him to have another number nine. What about in general terms though? How likely do you feel you are to add to your squad? Whether it's another striker, whether it's a center, whatever. No, I think I've said after Monday evening that um that again I could make a substitution that impacted the game. That's what Fed Rico did against Bulma and that's what Rio did now against um against Newcastle. So um as always uh we tried to sign players that can help us, but there's no reason after the first two games uh to complain or to think we need more. But if we can strengthen the squad, then we will always try to do that. if it's for the right money and it's the right player. Um, and there are only three four days to go now. So, yeah, let's see if we do something. And if we do something, what we can do from the players that you're working with this weekend and obviously it is a big game. What improvement do you feel you need to see that will give you the best chance of maintaining your own 100% record and ending Arsenals? No, the most simple answer to that is a lot. uh because we face a very strong team that was already really good last season and I think uh I've improved their squad a lot during the summer. So um yeah and if you then look at all the quality they have but especially one thing that stands out in in the season till now and what stands out in a negative way for us is that we've conceded if I include the Bil Bao game four set pieces and of course as we all know that's one of their strengths not the strength but one of their strengths because they can play in multiple ways. You can see how well they are managed by Miguel when they working for five years together because they can play almost every style there is in football and that tells you how well managed they are. Uh but one of their strength is also set pieces and um that is an area where we if you look at Monday when we faced Newcastle we conceded two and against BBA we conceded two. This part we need to improve uh where we by the way were really good at last season. So uh no panicking at all. We also had to defend in Newcastle 350 pieces. So then only conceding two was not even so bad. Obviously both games against Arsenal finished in two all draws and I think against top four opposition or the teams that finished in the top four last season you took 11 points from a possible 18. I just wonder even though it's such an early stage in the in in the season, how important do you feel it is not to lose ground on a potential title rival? Nah, not so much to do with with losing ground, but in in Yeah, it has to do with losing ground, but not that we play Arsenal. So, it's more in the beginning of the season, you want to normally normally teams don't play their best game unless you keep the same squad completely and you add three, four, five, six, seven players, then you can maybe expect that the team is growing even further. Um, if you look at our situation, we've lost a few, we've added a few. So then it's not starting all the way new again, but um I think it's normal that we play even better, even better, not better, but even better uh uh in a few months than we do or in a few weeks than we do now. Um but in the meantime, you can't lose ground. Uh not a lot. Um although I do think that it's uh I would be surprised if there will be a point record this season in the in the in the Premier League. I would be surprised if one team gets more than 100 points because of the strength of the league. Uh so you are able to drop once in a while a few points and still be competitive in I think in the end of the season, but the best thing you can do is not drop points at all. Thank you. Anna, just picking up on what you said there then, do you think that the league is more competitive noticeably this season than last season based on what what you've just said? if that's even possible because it was already so competitive last season, but maybe I'm wrong, but I think in general teams spent more than last season. Um, I'm not 100% sure and I'm talking about net spend, not talking about what pe what team spent and forget then what they've sold, but in terms of net spend, but maybe I'm wrong, but um um last season we didn't do a lot, but I think our competitors didn't do a lot last season as well. And that's completely different this season. Obviously, it's very early to maybe with the exception of Chelsea last season maybe, but I think Arsenal Man City didn't do so many signings last season. Um, so that's the difference between this season. Obviously, it's very early to be making assessments and judgments and drawing any sort of firm conclusions and Arsenal have got injuries as well, but what do you see as the key differences that your team will need to be aware of this time against them compared to last year with the new players they've added? Wow. Um, I think there are a lot of similarities with both teams. So, I I don't think the playing style of Arsenal changed a lot with the new signings coming in. Uh, they So, uh, maybe maybe they have a different number nine than they had last season. Although, Jesus was also a real number nine, but didn't play that much. But I think the one they have now is different to Havitz for example or Trasada played uh last season in in in our G in our home game over there. So that is more a false nine you could say where I think Karees is more a target man. So that's maybe a small difference where we have to know and he makes maybe even more runs in behind than than the other nominous nines did. But in general, I see a lot of similarities between last season and this season with the style of play they have. And I think it's the same with us. Thank you, Anna. Uh, it's hard to imagine a more sparkling start to his Liverpool career for a striker than Hugo Eat. Goals in his his first three important games. As a finisher, that's fantastic. But but at least two of the goals he's been the starting point with the the goal against Bournemouth and also against Newcastle. How impressed have you been with him so far? And what are the facets that that he has in his game that can see him make even a lot more improvement and add you know greater attacking elements to your game? Uh I think you've already made a big impact as you said in our attacking part of our game. So not only scoring goals but also be part of of of buildup situations where he was someone that started the attack or was part of us starting attack. I think that is not talking about a difference a bit more than last season where um although when Luchio played there he was also a lot of times part of of our buildup. The most simple answer to what he can improve is his match match fitness. So, uh I expect him um to do even a lot a lot more without the ball uh than he already does because he's already working hard. But, uh yeah, there there we can improve which is completely normal because he has to adjust from a different league, from a different playing style. Uh so, uh Frankfurt wasn't as pressing as much as they pressed, but not as much as we tried to do. and then coming to a different country, coming to a different league. Um, yeah, there's a there's a lot for him to handle. And then if we come back after the international break, it's uh it's Champions League games added to that where he was used to playing I think Europa League, which is also a good level, but not as high as Champions League. So there is the main point of improvement, I think. Uh um which is completely normal because he came a bit later in preseason. Um, so to adapt to the intensity levels without the ball, I think that's the that's there's a there are small steps to make for him. In the league game so far against Bournemouth and again Newcastle where Liverpool at times were really up against it. It's admirable and a real quality to find a way to win under those circumstances, but it's not sustainable, is it, throughout the season, particularly as you know, against opposition like Arsenal on Sunday. So, what's the the key to improving the playing strategy where you're going to have more controlling games? Not playing every game at St. James Park. Uh, no, I would like to play every single game at Anfield. Um but against the Bulma of team where we had a hard time against last season as well when we were 3 up they just kept on coming uh which now led to a goal and all of a sudden was a game where they had the chances last season as well. So um not conceding set pieces would also help with controlling the game a bit more because I don't think after halftime we had control over the game but then conceding a set piece and then the whole stadium felt that it was something to win for them again. Um so yeah, of course we can improve things which is normal if you have to uh um I think it was in the charity shield where five positions were different than the main start the main starters we had last season and I think that hasn't changed that much against Bournemouth and also against uh against Newcastle there. So it's then it's normal that we can still improve things but we could even with the team of last season improve a lot of things I can tell you. Um, but I don't think we had any control over the game last season in the first 15 minutes against Newcastle as well. I think we even played worse over there in that first 50 minutes. So, you need to compare the right things with each other. You cannot compare the start of last season with the opposition we faced then to the start of this season. that is um although all the teams are very strong but Newcastle away is I think everybody agrees on that one of the diff most difficult fixtures you can have and Arsenal at home is not any different to that. Thank you I wanted to ask you about Florian V. I felt like Newcastle did a really good job of denying him the ball with their bank of five across the midfield. I think he only received 19 passes compared to 34 against Bournemouth. If that situation is repeated perhaps against Arsenal, would you like him to maybe work harder to maybe come deeper to search for the ball or is the onus more on his teammates to maybe be a bit braver and try and pass through the lines? No, no, this is all nothing to do with it. The only answer I can give is what you probably know because you're quite good in data. Normally, you always you started with data this this question. So you should add in this question that there was only 40% ball in play in Newcastle. So then to have a lot of touches is quite difficult. And when the ball was in play, the ball was in the air. So they didn't block anything. The ball was just in the air and it was dual after duel after dual after dual. Um set pieces to defend, set pieces to attack. So um there was not much football over the ground. So you were talking about Forian, but I also know that Mo would have loved to touch the ball a little bit more than he did in Newcastle, but he didn't touch the ball. He touched the ball more this time in Newcastle than he did last season. And he did touch the ball more this season against New I'm talking about Mo than he did against in the League Cup. So it's also the opposition you face the the playing style of the other team you face. And I've said last season after Plymouth that if we would have been there with the starters, we probably also wouldn't have played a good game. And everybody was looking at me, what are you saying? No, that playing style of every ball long, every set piece thrown into your box is is a playing style where it's not so easy to play your best game in for Florian or for Mo or for Yugo. I don't think Yugo touched the ball a lot. Um, and Cody didn't touch it probably a lot as well. So, 40% playing time. The last time that was happened was 2010 when Stoke City faced Samadise team. So, obviously those are rare statistics. Which was that? Was that Bolton? Blackburn. Blackburn. Okay. Obviously, those are rare statistics, but are you concerned that maybe some other teams might try to use that as a way of trying to keep some of your attacking players away from the ball, being more direct, keeping the ball that that not the first time that we faced this playing style. This happened last season as well. Um the difficult thing for us was that although the Newcastle players can play in a completely different style, really, really, really good as well, but this this style suits them also really well. If you look at how tall most of their players are and the deliveries the the set pieces from Treier are also uh high high high quality. So yeah that that makes it even more difficult. So I'm not saying sitting here saying that with the starters we would have had as difficult against Plymouth as we had against Newcastle. But in general, it's a it's a playing style where it's where it's where you have constantly have to be ready for every single ball. And um but but uh we can do better. It's not only the playing style. We can we can do better than we did at Newcastle or at Plymouth. Uh but um but it is but it's not the first time we faced this playing style. Many teams did this playing style last season as well. last one. Just on team news, Anna. Um, obviously a very physical game against Newcastle. I just wanted to check how uh the players have been in the intervening days and whether there are any doubts heading into the Arsenal game fitness wise that he didn't have before. No, no, I don't think so. I think um the positive is that uh that Connor Bradley uh only had one or two training sessions before the Newcastle game. He hasn't trained this week uh the whole week or the whole week. still two days to go but uh and Mcgallister started training again so I don't think we had any injury coming out of that game. No, and Virgil is also okay. I think that's the main thing you would maybe question but he's he's okay. Yeah. And one more if I can on Rio and Gamoa. I mean obviously there's been a lot of talk about him this week after his goal and what what role do you see him playing for you this season? What what you see is the best way to manage him and longer term, how far can he go in? Left winger. Left winger is the role I see for him or is that not what you mean? No, no, no. On a serious note, um we we I think this whole uh uh um how do you say this? This whole uh press conference started with uh also with spending of us all other clubs in the in the Premier League. And a nice part of it all is that then in the end the 16 year old coming from the academy partly Chelsea partly ours um scores the winning goal. So that's also the beauty of still our football that um although we've spent a lot sold a lot as well there's still room that's the that's also the reason if we only spent enough sold and there was probably not room for him but um but now there is room for him is room is that a good way to say yeah and he can show his qualities and uh as things stand now there's still room for him to show that in the upcoming game as well because um we haven't made any signing. So, I think he will be on the bench again and has a fair chance of coming in if if if it's needed in the game. Thank you. Thanks. You're welcome.

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. All right, Benny. Anna, first of all, obviously appears that you're ing reinforcements in the forward line and in the back line. So, Alexander Isaac and Mark Gay, what can you tell us at the situations regarding potential for them to at least become Liverpool players before the deadline? >> Uh, what I can tell you is not a lot and if someone else is going to ask that question, it's going to be the same answer. So, um, as I said so many times, uh, and and it's been shown on Friday as well. I could even impact the game Friday with the players we had on the bench. Federrico came in, scored a goal. So, um, it would be much nicer for us to talk about the players we have and for me. But I can al also understand that you have to ask this question, but your superior probably told you and I know what his answer is going to be. I told my >> or are you at the >> same time? What are you expecting going to Newcastle? Because obviously a lot of things have been said off the pitch. So that could potentially add to the atmosphere as well as maybe even Newcastle's motivation. >> Nothing to do with anything uh that's in the media a lot. But I think if you go to to Newcastle, you know what to expect. We've played them three times last season and uh twice um their intensity levels were above ours. So in the away game, especially first 60 minutes, 60 minutes they were so so so intense. They were fully deserved. Uh had the lead and in the in the League Cup final, they were more intense than us as well. So I don't think they need anything to add for them being intense if they play at St. James's Park, Elisa. Yeah, they play at St. James's Park. So yeah, it's uh apart from the intensity, it's a very good team. They have also a team that can that can make it a fight if you want to call it like this. They have players for this, but they also have players that are so comfortable in the ball. So one of the best teams in the league and one of the most difficult away games that you can have in a season, especially as you say it here, under the lights. Yeah, under the lights. So uh so yeah. What difference can Ryan Granberg coming back make to your overall solidity? >> I think a lot. Uh at least if he's the same player as he was last season, that could help us a lot. If you just simply look at the second goal we conceded, they they could just go from one side from the 18 yard box to the other side uh without being attacked, which was smart because Virgil and Ibu needed to go back because it was a four versus two situation. But I think if you if you look back at last season and everything single time he played Ryan would have been in that position and um and for him not being there and us playing with very good players but very attacking minded players um no that for example hurt us in that and that goal and that wasn't the first time where we lacked a player in that position in the counterattack for the other team. So normally if he brings his normal level uh it would definitely help us to have him back again. >> Just a word on the fitness of the squad. Is there any uh news about Frong and and Brady's fitness? >> Yeah. Uh Connor trained for a few minutes with us today for the first time and um medical team was completely right about Jeremy to tell me that I had to take him off because he's out till the end of the international break. Um and that was happened in the game. So uh I think I got criticized a bit by taking him off, didn't I? Yeah. And I've already said immediately after the game uh this had nothing to do with how we played but that uh we felt that he had an issue in his hamstring and with we I don't mean me but the medical staff and they were completely right. So uh could call to take him off otherwise he would have maybe been out for longer and we expect to have him back after the international break. and the most sort of recent um signing Giovani. Um how's he looked in training and is he when do you think he could be involved with something? >> No, he's a good-looking guy. So, uh as most Italians, um he trained with us three times now, I think. Um if you look at his transfer fee, you can expect that he's already quite grown up. uh uh for his age. Uh and that's exactly what I saw. Uh so he comes in as an 18year-old just playing with his new teammates as if he's here for longer. Uh impressive if you look at how tall he is, fast, comfortable on the ball. So um yeah, there's a reason why we paid the transfer fee as we did because we see him as a as a as a right prospect. Is that a good English? and he had already three good sessions. But um it also tells you something about the team. If you come to this club, if you come into this team, you feel at ease from the start because it's a very good and nice group uh to start your Liverpool career in. >> How big a concern is that right back area for you now? Because you mentioned Connor Bradley doing some training. Joe Gomez has had his injury problems as well. Now, Jeremy Frimpon, all of a sudden, it looks like you were well stocked in that area, but are you concerned about the the fitness and how sort of the records have been with with the others that that might be fit? >> No, Jeremy has a very positive injury record. Uh Connor has been out one once or twice last season. Yeah, these things happen in a season. Uh we only have at the moment two injuries unfortunately, two for the same position. Uh but the good thing is that some other player can play in that position as well. Wata played in that position uh for a few minutes. Dominic Sllay already probably in that position. So there are other options we can explore. Joe Gomez is definitely one of them but um but for him to already play 20 minutes that was already quite a lot. Um I wouldn't say he had a setback but he wasn't able to train three days in a row completely with the team. Uh which is completely normal if you're out for so long and all of a sudden the manager needs you for 20 minutes. Um but but he's training with the team so let's see where he is on Monday if he can be involved in the team or if he can even start. But there are other options we have as well in this position. It's just yeah you cannot prepare for two injuries in one position. Would be stupid for us to have three fullbacks or five left backs. Although we have three left backs at the moment so we're unlucky that the right fullbacks are injured. Yeah. >> And you briefly mentioned it before. a what a moment for him coming off the bench to get his goal against Bournemouth. Do you see him as having a a bit more of a role to play this season? I know injuries hampered him last season. Do you think he'll have a more significant role in your team this time? >> Yeah, if he's if he's more available then he has already more ch more chances to impact uh impact um our results or his playing time. So uh so yeah, but then it's about him staying as fit as he is at the moment. So, uh, I see a totally different Feder Rico now than through large parts of last season, which is completely normal because he missed out on the whole preseason and then comes into a Premier League rhythm in terms of amount of games and in terms of intensity. So, uh, he's in a much better place now. And as we can all see, um, when we needed a goal and I looked at the bench, I only had him and Rio, a 16 year old as attacking options. So yeah, for me, although Rio did really well in preseason, it was quite a uh a normal choice to make to bring him in, and he uh he delivered. >> You obviously don't want to talk about specifics in terms of players coming in, but you mentioned maybe that lack of of options in terms of attacking players coming on. Is it going to be a busy couple of weeks in terms of adding to your squad depth before the the window closes? No, I don't think so because then I then I should be unhappy with the squad we're having and I'm very very happy about the squad we are having. So um I've always said um maybe having two per position is ideal but but I prefer less than more because you have to disappoint so many players every single time for them not even being in a squad let alone not playing. So, so yeah, really happy with the squad. But as always, if we think we can improve in a certain position and there's a player available that can really make us better um which you could see with Giovanni Leone, it's uh then we are uh then this club has always shown that they uh bring these players in but only if everything is what we want. So the right transfer fee, the right player, the right position and uh and a player that wants to come to us. >> Hi, um you've spoken previously about the difficulty of changing so many players in the starting 11 and perhaps the influence that's maybe had on some of the defensive structures. Um it's rare to have 10 days between games in the Premier League, even at this stage of the season. How helpful has that been to be able to get more time with the players on the training pitch and maybe kind of drill some of the structures a little bit more? >> No, of course it's helpful. Um, but we did had a good preseason. We had six weeks. Um, compared to last season where we only had two. Yeah, we had six weeks as well, but only two with with with most of the players. So, we've had our time to train already. And I think that's also what you could see against the bottom of game because it was if you look at data uh running stats, it was the most intense game uh that has played in the weekend. So that tells you that our match fitness is is where we want it to be and where we need it to be if you need to go to Newcastle by the way. Um, but it's also clear that in preseason, that's what I said, I mixed up lineups and then it's quite normal that you don't see every time the right connection between some players or some lines. Um, but that was already very good against Bil Bao and okay to good against Palace and Bournemouth. Another thing about having new players in, I noticed that against Bournemouth and in fact then the second goal against Crystal Palace, they all came after double substitutions uh in quite soon after making double changes. So is maybe getting used to the reorganizing and getting used to some of the demands for those new players is that maybe going to eradicate some of those issues as well. Now most most changes I've made in the game are are due to match fitness and players were not available in the whole preseason. So Hugo Iikitk for example that I took off twice uh needs to make a step from Bundesliga to Premier League uh and missed out a part of preseason. So and you want to keep him fit for the upcoming games, weeks, months as well. It's the same with Mcgallister who was not able to start in my opinion yet against Palace but I think he needed playing time. It's the same why I started him against uh against Bournemouth. Was he already on the top of his level? No. But to get there he needs playing time. So I had to take him off. Now, you just spoke about Jeremy who comes from a different league and um so yeah, you need to take this into account although that's sometimes difficult for a fan or a pundit because they're like, ""Yeah, you need to win this game. Yeah, we need to win this game, but we need to keep them fit for the rest of the season as well."" And we do have uh players on the bench that that are equal to the ones that start. So then you need you need to use your squad. So, I see it as a coincidence that we've conceded our goals after the substitutions, but uh time will tell if I'm right or wrong. >> But on the other hand, we also scored a goal after a substitution, too, by the way, from Fed Rico and Mo. >> Last one for Carl. >> Hi, Anna. Um, you spoken about Newcastle and how difficult the atmosphere will be there, but the as a club they've got a few issues at the moment in terms of, you know, they haven't got the transfers they probably wanted. their star striker is missing. Does that make it easier for you in a way to go there knowing that they're they've got a club with troubles? >> I don't think there are a club of troubles. Uh they had a very good start of the season against Fella. Good game for them. I think they were able to get more out of the game than the one point they got. So uh it's not only it's it's not only difficult or it's mainly difficult because of the players they are having there not only because of the fans but the atmosphere is great like it is at Anfield. So we are used to a certain environment but St. James's Park is if I if I just remember last season where it was in an evening game by the way as well the atmosphere was amazing and it will be the same. But why is the atmosphere amazing? Because the players can perform. they can add to the atmosphere by being as intense as they were bringing the quality as they brought in that game. So that's going to be the challenge. The challenge is is is of course also playing in a stadium where the fans will be there for the home team and that always helps every home team. I can tell you about us. So the last 15 to 20 minutes at Anfield, it wasn't a coincidence that we scored twice because the fans helped us in that moment of time. But if you only have fans and you don't have the players, then you can forget it. So the main thing uh we have to be ready for are their midfielders, their last line, their their free forwards. And although uh I assume I'm not sure, but I assume Isak is not playing from what I read in the media, but they still have Anthony Gordon as a nine. They still have Elanga as a left winger, a right winger, sorry, and and Barnes from the left. And then Jacob Murphy isn't even playing, who was very good against us twice last season. So this is the Premier League. We all have a lot of options and Newcastle have them as well. >> It's fine for me then. Um you won your first game 42. It was a great night. Were you surprised by some of the criticism you got after that game? >> Did I what was a good >> just in terms of you know sort of maybe the way way you you your side approached it. There was yeah people saying you're too open. You're more open last season. Um or or is that just the the high bar that you set that the team has set itself as champions? >> Uh of course uh of course that has something to do with the bar we set. Uh and I agree we were at moments to open. Uh first goal was I think mainly unlucky uh that we lost the ball in a position we shouldn't lose it and then uh we were free against three which is normally not a problem but we at a disadvantage to our opponents Ibu and Rabo. Second goal is definitely being too open. So if all your free midfielders are inside the box and where we're just talking about Ryan, um that's too open. So I agree on that. Um but also the reason why we scored a free two that it was one of our midfielders, Curtis Jones arrived in the box who made it difficult for the goalkeeper. Ball fell to Fedrico. So it's also who we are, but we need to find the right balance uh by not being too open. But that balance will be better with Ryan. Unfortunately, if you want to judge me or us, we now have to play Newcastle and Arsenal, who are normally teams that going to be above Bournemouth in the league. Uh so it's even harder uh to play against them. But um with Maka being back with Ryan in his normal position, we are I expect us to be even better prepared for the counter attack than we were in this 2-2 moment because I've watched the game I think twice back and I don't think there's apart from the two goals where this especially the second one is a counterattack I don't think there were many other counterattacks from Bonov. But yeah, if it leads to a goal, it's of course a big story. And um for us conceding two, that's too much in a home game. So yeah, that's too open.

Liverpool,2025/26,Arne Slot,C6Ss_CmIhBI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Ss_CmIhBI,2025-08-14,"could have been a trophy better. But >> um Anna, I guess asked you about half last week, but it seems that you might be able to bring to it. First of all, Giovani Leone, what can you tell us? >> That the clubs have agreed a deal, but he hasn't signed for us yet. So, um the moment when he signs for us, I can go into more detail. Uh, and the other one is of course the answer you always get from me. >> Are you able to talk about that a little bit more broadly though and say what expectation you have possibly getting old Mark? >> No. Uh, no. Because he's not our player and uh unfortunately he was the captain of the team where we lost against uh uh last Sunday. So, uh, no, if you want to have any talks about him, you should go to Palace to Blaster and ask him his opinion about him. >> Well, obviously the focus is on the start of your title defense. So, how ready do you feel you and the squad are now going into the start of the season? >> As ready as we can be. Um, so I think I've I've emphasized le last week on the fact that we've lost three or four starters and uh unfortunately Ryan was not able to play last week and is not able to play this week. So that means that if you exclude the goalkeeper from the 10 uh outfield positions, five were different than than the main starters we had last season. And if you then look the quality we bring on the ball, uh I'm very happy uh with that. Uh without the ball, it's eight out of 10 times also very good. But the aim at this club is not eight out of 10 times, it's 10 out of 10 times. And that is the finetuning we still need to find defensively. Uh and that went that went in preseason one time better than the other one up against Bil Bao. I was really really really pleased with our defensive performance because we didn't gave away any chance at all I think out of open play but we did concede two set pieces against Palace. Uh we um we conceded the main chances we competed conceded were when we lost the ball ourselves. So uh it's been ups and downs where the downs were not so low. Uh but I think there is the main part for us uh still to improve which is normal I think for everyone in preseason it's normal that there's still room for improvement let alone if um we not only lost three or four starters we've I think we've lost five to six players that played quite a lot of minutes for us last season and we brought in four I think four new ones so then it's normal to uh that there's a little bit of adaptations but we are definitely ready for the league to start >> taking all that into account given what you achieved last season and how difficult it is to go back to back with Premier League titles. What are your expectations for the season? >> Yeah, but the reason why that is so difficult lays mainly in the fact there are so many competitors that can also win the league over here. So, uh to win it once is already very special let alone if you if you can win it twice in three, four, five years or as we did twice in five years and City did even better than us in the last few years. So that's unbelievable if you're able to do this in this league. Uh and and probably this year is going to be harder than every year before because um every team brings in new players, but our our our main competitors definitely did as well. >> In that regard, obviously this time last year, you had a huge challenge ahead of you with coming to a new league, starting at a new club, replacing your club, everything that went with it. Is this season in your mind even personally for you an even bigger challenge from this time last year? >> No, you forgot you forget to mention that you take over a team and you only have two weeks to prepare because they were was a Euros and um and a and a Copa America. I think every preseason, every season has its own challenges. So last season it were the challenges you were just talking about. This season the challenge is that that we've lost many starters and we tried to bring in and not try we've brought in um very good and talented players again as well. Uh and the challenge is always not only yourself but also the teams you face now. We starting with Bournemouth which was last season probably the most intense team in the league. Um and I mean in terms of running um and also in the playing style but that goes hand in hand. And then afterwards is Newcastle and uh and Arsenal. So that sums up this league I think and the challenge we have. >> What do you expect from B on Friday? >> What I just said intense. They we they made it really difficult for us last season. We beat them 3-0 where you feel like what is he talking about about difficult but if you look at the game they had the first big chance of the game. They scored a goal which was fractionately offside and then we three times I wouldn't say counterattacked them but we were very fast in uh uh uh in in moving the ball from back to to forward and all of a sudden at halftime we were 3-0 up and then I thought wow which I always thought when I was playing manager in Holland this is going to be four five 6 nil uh but the mentality uh Bournemouth showed in the second half they just they just kept on going and that's the mentality they had throughout the whole season uh afterwards as well. So, uh they also uh lost some players. They also brought in good new ones as they've shown in the last few years uh that they can always bring in good new players. So, um and a way it was even more difficult for us. So very good team, good manager and a challenge for us uh on Friday, but looking forward to it because playing an evening game at Anfield is something everything everyone is looking forward to, I think. >> Hi there, Anna. Um your defensive record last season was absolutely incredible in the preseason so far. I know you haven't been particularly happy with some elements of it. Uh h how do you resolve those issues when you're looking for that defensive solidity in front of your back four when you're going to be without again the best defensive midfielder in the country? >> Yeah. And don't forget we missed outer as well the last part of last season and he he hardly wasn't able to play in our preseason. Only now recently he's played a few games, played a few minutes. Um, but it's not that I'm not happy about certain parts. I'm telling you just a second ago that I'm the standard here is 10 out of 10. So, it's not one or two things we don't do well. No, in general, we do all well, but well is not good enough. Uh, and there we can we have to go go one step up in certain aspects. Not in all aspects, in certain aspects. And then there's also something like like I said against Bil Bao we were really good defensively but conceded two set pieces and the games before we also had mixed teams. So then you can also accept a little bit better that maybe timings between players were not as good as when you play the starters that has played so many times together. So there are reasons for it. Uh like what I just said, mixed teams. Uh new players coming in, Firgil being sick against Bilbao, Allison not being there, Maka being injured, Ryan not able to play, and new players brought in. But all of this is definitely not an excuse when we start the league Friday because we will 100% be ready on Friday. >> Integrating new players into the Liverpool way of doing things is all part and parcel of preseason and early season as well. and a lot to like about Jeremy Fri what we've seen of him so far. Played really well at Wembley in parts, but he's a different type of fullback to Trent Alexander Arnold, who was a complete one-off and a different type of fullback to Connor Bradley. And do you have to sort of try and make sure that that somebody as adventurous as Fred Hong is with his dribbling that he doesn't impinge on MoSalah's sort of ability to get into those key areas and kind of his effectiveness. >> Um, in my opinion, Jeremy and Connor Bradley are similar types, by the way. Although Jeremy is maybe better in the one v1s than uh Connor is, but I think Jeremy and Connor can both attribute to Mo's uh output because if you play against these two, you know, you have to you have to be aware of these two as well. Uh so it it normally gives more Mo even more space to get the one v ones. Uh because if we isolate Jeremy in a 1 v one, it's difficult for the other team. And if we isolate Mo in a one v one, it's difficult for the other team as well. So uh where maybe last season they could give a little bit of more help because Trent was a little bit more behind the ball, which was also dangerous because when Mo brought it back, Trent could deliver one of his famous crosses. So, it's different types, but I think uh both times both types and and and and and Trent proved it together with Mo. Trent brought the best out of Mo and um and I I uh we think I think that that's the same thing is going to happen with with Connor and and Jeremy with Mo in that regard. >> Thank you, >> Span Turner. Sky Germany. Hi, Anna. talking about Florian um still a young guy first time away from home one of the biggest clubs um in the world um that enormous transfer fee on his back. How's he handling all that on and off the pitch? >> Yeah, he's he might be young but he already won a lot. So, uh, we I don't think we, yeah, factually we can see him as a young player, but in terms of his experience that he's already having, I don't see him as a young player. Won the league in Germany, won the cup, played for his country numerous times. Um, and apart from that, his his mentality is is is maybe his biggest strength, and that says a lot because if you see him play, you're like, are you serious? Because he's so creative. But how mentally strong he is. uh uh and uh he doesn't get distracted at all by a transfer fee or anything else. So um I think uh good players always find a way to play well in good teams and he is a good player and he plays in a good team. >> Doesn't need any help of yours. >> Yeah, he does like like all the others. Um, but we have a very good uh player care department. So, I'm not uh looking for houses together with him or uh these kind of things. But on the pitch and on the training ground and in videos, he needs help in for him to understand the way we want to play. That's not 180 degrees different than Shabi Alonzo. The system is different, but we want to be intense. Shab Alonzo wanted to be intense. He liked to dominate the position. Chavi would try to bring him in in in in positions we want to try to bring him in. So a lot of things are the same for him. But it's true he has to adjust to England, to the league, to the intensity um and to his new teammates as well. But um but I think if you saw the games um his adjustment went uh quite well, more better than even expected and we already expected a lot. >> Hi. Um you mentioned Gran Burke earlier. Um he was one of your regular fixtures last season. Played such an important role. You didn't have him last week. You you not got him this week and you just have a certain set of skills that maybe other players in the team don't have. So how how you missed him last week in terms of defensive parts of the game and and how do you sort of compensate for that not be here this week as well? I think last Sunday the the chances we conceded were mainly because three times we lost the ball very simple in our midfield and they could counterattack us. Um so um yeah you could say Ryan is always taking really good care of the ball over there but players Ryan or anyone else in our team can lose the ball. So in that sense I'm not sure how much we missed him last Sunday but it's clear that Ryan has had a big impact on us last season. And it's quite now it's not funny but but I don't I can find another word that probably everybody has forgotten how he got his suspension. He got two yellow cards. The first one for a dive. Now there's one team in the league that is in my opinion by far the most honest team when they play. I sometimes blame them that they never try to make from a foul a little bit more. Uh like uh Cody in the 22 we conceded against Palace. He got a push in his back but he was far too clean. So, if there's any one team in the league that is very clean and never dives and never time delays and all these kind of things, then it's us. And we have a suspension now for a player diving where he get his first yellow card for um but yeah, I'm I I've said many times that probably the midfield uh might even be our strongest line when it comes to the bodies we have. Um, unfortunately, Maka had a bit of a uh different preseason than we would like him to have, but he's back fit now. So, I still have a choice to make in midfield, even if Ryan is not there. >> On that point then, do do you think your team needs to be a bit more street wise, especially this season as defending champions, in terms of how you approach the game? You say they're too honest, but do they need to sort of be a bit more street wise? No, I think I Yeah, maybe for me to use the right words in English, you can never be too honest, but um it's it's clear that um I saw uh this week fab and I saw uh very a lot a lot of moments where players were really really smart when uh when when um and and these kind of things should be used them. Yes or no? I'm not too sure. For me, the best game last season that I've been part of was Paris and Jim against uh against us, especially our home game. I like that a little bit more than the away game, by the way. But that was also so high intensity because those both teams were just there to play and not to try to pretend if a fall was more or time delaying or whatever. So, um I'm also proud of the fact of who we are and we won the league last season by the team we were. So um let us just stay who we are. Uh but sometimes I think it was a great moment also in the game against Palace and that is if I talk to referee I I I do talk about that as well to the fourth official Florian what they hold him clearly on the midfield but he was so fair that he didn't fall over and the referee said yeah if you don't fall I'm not going to give you a free kick which is a little bit weird and a fraction later they fell down in a in a moment which wasn't even a foul and the referee feels oh he fell down so probably is a foul so uh unless we had much more ball possession than Palace, but we made 13 fouls and they made five fouls and that says tells you also something about who we are and I'm not saying Palace is different than us and that that that not be the headline. Um but that that we are a very fair team. Um I think that's clear and maybe that's also the reason why we won the league. So why change something if things went well? pass. >> Hey, um you've spoken about the midfield and the changes there over the preseason without being without MCAT and obviously Floren coming in that seen Don Sai come a little bit deeper and we saw a little bit of that towards the end of last season at Brighton. How do you feel like he's adapted to this role? What things do you like? What things do you think he still needs to work on? >> I think he can play both roles really good and he has his quality in both roles and uh things he can improve in both roles. So I think what stands out with with Dominic is is the way he can press. So I don't think there are many midfielders in the world that you can find that are better in the intensity he can press with. Um but if he's at 10, I think the improvement he can make is is playing in between the lines, finding the balls over there and getting not the end product in goals but more the through balls. And if he's playing behind the ball, I think that's not new for him but but he hasn't played there a lot last season. So sometimes, yeah, you need to adjust to your teammates and in your positioning, but um I think he's had a really good preseason. He didn't play his best game against Palace, but for the rest, he had a very good preseason. >> I imagine he must be one of the players in the squad most pleased to see Joe Gomez come back as well because means he's less likely to be a backup right back for this next game. Is Joe ready to be in the squad for Friday? >> Uh I don't think if one has to do with the other. I'm not sure about that. But uh Joe, I have to make a decision on that. I think he only trained twice now. Missed quite a lot in preseason. But um if you looked at our bench against Palace, I think there were three players that were 18 years old or younger. If if Bandoke is Ben or has been 19 already 19. Okay. So 19 20 years or younger. Um so uh there is there is a possibility that Joe might be on the bench, but I have to look at the numbers and and who we're going to take. Yes, >> he's on. >> Thank you.","[{""text"": ""could have been a trophy better.

Chelsea,2025/25,Enzo Maresca,xP0H1TWDy0k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP0H1TWDy0k,2025-08-29,"And it's also been reported that any more incomings that would happen in the next few days. It's been reported as well that any more players to come into the club over the next few days would require some players to leave. Can we expect to see a lot of players leaving over the next couple of days? >> You can expect anything. The window transfer is open so anything can happen in and out. >> And are you confident and happy with the squad you've got at the moment or would you be looking to bring maybe another player in? I joined the club one year ago saying that I was in love with the squad and the squad I think getting better and better. So my feeling is exactly the same. >> And just a final one for me, last Friday we saw both Jav Pedjo and Liam Dap playing together. Is that something that you're looking forward to using for the rest of the season or was that more of a reaction to Cole Palmer being injured? You know, I guess I think we have been the team with more changes in in in entire season last season. So I'm not looking just for for two players to play always. I'm looking for different solution. For sure they can play together. But uh it's the game plan that uh demanding if is one, two or both we see. >> Thank you Kim. Alex, >> hi Enzo. So you've just said no Cole Palmer at the weekend, but how much of a boost was it but for everyone at the club scoring five goals away from home without him last Friday? >> For sure 100% and I will say again we are much much much better team with co no doubt uh but when co is not in the game we need to find different solution. Last last week we found different solution and hopefully we can find tomorrow uh again different solution. Three more days to go until the window closes. What happens to those players if they're not sold or or loaned out? The ones that have been training apart, what's the plan for them? >> No idea to be honest. I don't know. I just uh you know that uh they are not even with us. They are training with different time with different uh different pitch. So I don't have any idea. This is not u I don't know. >> That could be reintegrated maybe. >> I don't know. We see when the window transfer to close. We see and we decide. >> Fulham the last visiting side to win at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League. What makes Marco Silva's team hard to play against? >> They are solid. They are well organized. They play nice football. They are very strong and uh it's not random that they are doing well. Last year was record of points in Premier League. I think for Fulham they show how Marcos is good. the players, they are good. So, it's a game that like always we need to to be careful. >> I know it's been a bit of a whirlwind for you since the end of the club World Cup. Are you welcoming an international break at a chance for a bit of a breather? >> Yeah. Yeah. Fantastic. >> How do you plan to use it the time off? >> Yeah. Yeah. Now, we're going to especially for the players will be a good time for us also for sure. But especially for the players, the ones that they don't go with international team uh that also they need to they need to recover >> holidays. a holiday. >> No holiday, but uh we're going to try to recover the energy. >> Thanks, Enzo. Good luck weekend. >> Thanks, Alex. Nazar. >> Hi, Enzo. Um, how long is Cole Palmer out for? And could Lavia and um Batty Shili be back after the international break? >> Uh, Cole, we need to see day by day. And the other two, I don't think they want to be uh back after the international break, but they want to be more closer. >> Okay. Are you a bit worried about their fitness or do you think they'll be back relatively soon? Benoir and Romeo Lavia, are you worried about their fitness longer term? Is it a problem for you tactically and with the squad with your options? >> I'm always worried but not about just them. I'm always worried but I think with the Romeo Benois because it's long time out. It's normal that they need uh time, they need session. It's the same that we are doing with Wes. Wes is back. The other day play some minutes. Hopefully we can give him more minutes and slowly slowly get the right condition. And if Kinku and Jackson leave, do you think you could sign another attacker? Do you think Chelsea might sign another one if they both leave? >> I don't know. >> Thanks, Nazar. Simon, >> hello. How you doing? Um, in terms of Cole and England, was that a discussion that that sort of happened between Chelsea and England to make sure that he he'd be left out? I spoke with Thomas a few times uh but then at the end is is is Thomas decision so we decided for that but uh uh again he's not available tomorrow so it's quite normal that uh is show that he has he has some problems >> and do you have a time frame in mind for for Romeo coming back um this obviously still not played a full 90 minutes for Chelsea is he going to have to be really carefully managed a bit like how you've you managed to get Ree back playing regularly again. >> Yeah, I think uh two years ago he didn't play uh any game. Last year he played some games. Uh this season the target again is to give him more games and often the moment that he's back he can be he can be fit for for a long time and play more minutes more games uh because it's it's a player that we really trust. >> Thank you Simon. October sort of thing or October for return. >> I don't know. I don't know. >> And and just quickly on the Champions League draw cuz no one's asked you about the Champions League draw. >> Uh confident Chelsea progressing with that list of fixtures. >> Uh first of all, we are happy to be in the in the you know in the in the in the draw. We are happy very happy because I think we uh we brought this club where this club has to be Champion League. Now the draw it's always uh it's always a draw. Uh the only thing I can say that it's nice to be there and then when we start the Champion League we're going to start talking about that >> and we will begin end with David >> uh I want to bring you back to the Champions League. Sorry to do that. Uh Napoli and Atlanta on the road with the Euro return to Italy. Are you looking forward to those games and what do you think of those two teams? They are both fantastic team. Napoli just won the league with Antonio and Atlanta in the last five six year with Gasperini for me has been probably the best Italian team also in Europe. Uh so both both they are very good team. happy to come back to Italy, especially for, you know, to eat some good food and yeah and excited for the for the for the draw for the championing >> and one of the players going out in Kungu is reported to be going to AC Milan. What do you think Italian fans should expect from Kungu? >> Christo is a fantastic professional first of all with us. He was very professional, training very well. Uh the only problem with Kristo has been that in his position there was another player like Cole. So it was was difficult for him to get minutes but uh they can expect fantastic thing first of all because he's very professional and second because he's very good player.","[{""text"": ""And it's also been reported that any"", ""start"": 0.08}, {""text"": ""more incomings that would happen in the"", ""start"": 1.68}, {""text"": ""next few days.

Um, is there any clarity on whether the player is unhappy or happy at the club? Well, I spoke with Wes every day. It's very very happy first of all because he's back from the injury. is joining all the session with us and is is very happy and uh as I said after Palace game he was on the bench just to be with us but from tomorrow he is with us and he can also get some minutes so we are happy and he's happy then about uh Instagram as you know unfortunately I don't have an idea because uh I don't used to to to to use uh social network. On some of the comments after that, there were some pretty unsavory messages from fans. Is he getting the support from the club and are all players getting that continued support? Because it just feels like we're having often these conversations over and over again surrounding abuse to players. As I said in this moment, uh Wes is happy. We are happy. uh and there is nothing to add on that now uh I think if there are abuse as you said on Instagram never is good it's not good for west it's not good for any uh player and it's not good for any human being in the world uh but it's something that unfortunately we cannot uh we cannot control now let's move on to a team who said obviously Wesley's available tomorrow probably to play some minutes any of the injured players coming back at all for you? No, Romeo is still out. Uh, Bena uh is still out. As I said, West is back and that's all. And Nicholas Jackson suspended last week. Obviously, we understand the situation where he's potentially looking at another club, but is he available in your eyes tomorrow? He is available but he's not going to be a part of the squad because as we already said uh uh we have two striker we have two players in that position and also uh we know that uh uh something can happen uh before the window transfer close. And is there anything on the horizon with Nicholas Jackson departing? Is there does he look close to a move away at the moment? No idea to be honest. No idea. You know already from last season that uh I prefer uh to be focused on on train session prepare the game and these kind of things. Uh I don't know and I assume that would be the same answer for Raheem Sterling Christopher and Kunku. Is that the same situation? Kristo is with us like Niko but he's the same answer than Niko and the other two players they are training apart waiting for some solution. Enzo, what would happen at the end of the transfer window? You got quite a few players there if they were to remain at Chelsea. Could you integrate them back into No idea. No idea. It's not the moment to be honest. We have still as you said two two weeks 10 day two weeks but uh not idea also because uh it's difficult to plan because anything can happen. Okay. Thanks. Thanks James Sa. Hi Enzo. Uh you touched on this briefly before about Xiao Pedro and Lindel playing together but all his time in in in a Chelsea show he's played as a nine. We've seen him play between the lines at his other clubs. What situation would you play them together and what other positions do you see? playing. Is he a second striker, left winger? I think Jaw with us, he can play at the five position at front, the winger, wide or inside the pitch or behind the striker. Uh I think he can play in all the position for sure probably as as a nine or behind the striker is his best position, but uh he can play he can play in all attacking position for us. You've spoken about how you view your defensive options and you said it's not just being a central defender with Levi Koal being out. It's about being used to the way you play and tossing is probably the best suited for that. But you've got Hat, you got Aan Pong needing a bit of time. Alsino as well, but are you going to change and adapt? Is this something in your mind it would be possible for you to do not play play and build up from the back or is it going to be a situation if you don't get a center back, you're going to have to adapt and change that? No, there is not in my mind in my view not to play from the back. uh as we said many times you can be a little bit more direct when you face team that they try to be pressing but uh it's not in my mind at all uh to play in different way then I said already we are uh we use Josh in the last game we are trying to find some uh some internal solution and we see and you have West Ham next first away game of the season you beat them twice last season so familiarity a little it. What sort of tactical battle do you expect? Because last season you said, you know, their preseason, they haven't looked quite jelled yet. There's a little bit of pressure even though we're at the start of the season. You said those teams are the most teams that you need to be wary of because they have something to prove. So, what do you expect from that match? Tough game again. Uh all the all the Premier League game they are tough, they are difficult. Uh if you remember the play the game at home last year was difficult game for us. Uh they defend very well. Tomorrow I expect exactly the same. Um and again the Premier League just start so you can see that they are trying to find some solution in the same way we are we are doing. Thanks Sa John. Hi how are you getting on with the search for a center back? Are you confident that you will get one in by the end of the month? I already said that we are looking for internal solution and I showed that last game against Palace and we see we see we see what's happen. But you are you are looking externally as well for the team. We are trying with you know as I said already many times uh to find solution. Is everybody on the same page? Is that is that of the players you want to bring in? Is that now the priority for everybody at the club to get a center back? I said and I repeat again probably I need to improve my English. We are looking for internal solution until we see if something happen. Okay. And with players like Nicholas Jackson, Christopher Kungu, do you have to be careful the way not careful, but you have to handle them carefully because obviously there is a a scenario where they could be here in September and and you may still need them. We see we see if they're going to be here, they're going to be with us in case they are not here. That means that they uh uh they found a solution. And at the end, I think it's always better if they can find a solution because I think they're going to be more happy and the club the same. And just to follow on, where where do you think the squad are at the moment? Obviously, you've had a lack of preseason, you've had the club world cup. Is it is it going to take a couple of weeks to get up to 100%. You say for sure with more time we're going to be better and better. Uh but uh pace is where it is. We need to adapt. I think we show last week against Palace where until the end we compete until the end we create chances and as I said we're going to be better and better day after day. Thanks John Simon just checking on to is he still out and any long toin is uh is is is available is available for tomorrow. I'm a little bit surprised because last week it was not available and the day before it was everywhere that it was not available and now I don't know why you don't know that it's available. It's is available. Very good for you. No, because surprise me the last week against Palace the day before the game it was everywhere that was uh was not available and now you don't know that it's available the day before the game. Excellent. Uh I'm glad I came back and but on and he wasn't in the squad. Yeah. On Sunday. Is he in terms of your internal solution? Is he one of your options or is it still a possibility that he'll leave? Aaron is is is training with us is training very hard. He's fantastic boy, good player, but he needs to play games. He needs to he needs to go. He needs to play games. So it's it's another player that is waiting for solution. Thanks Simon. Okay, cameras off please. [Music] Hey, hey, hey.

Chelsea,2025/25,Enzo Maresca,RrcqSBlbKio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrcqSBlbKio,2025-08-15,"Enzo, good to see you. Uh, not too much of a a break for you with just a week to prepare pretty much for the start of the Premier League season. How ready do you feel you and squad are? We guess uh we are ready. Uh, but yeah, we need to wait uh for the real competition to verify that. Uh, as you said, that's been quite a short break. uh we're going to try to be ready. It's a unique buildup and a unique situation that you find yourself in for you as a coach. Is it almost learning on the job a little bit how this season will progress knowing that your your whole squad have had such a short preseason? Yeah, for sure it's something new. It's something that uh unfortunately we don't have the answer because never happened before. So uh from me from the sport sciences scientist from the doctor it's something new we don't have the answer uh we're going to react on this new situation that's why we need to be we need to pay attention all the all the details say pay attention to details in regards player welfare I can imagine obviously you lost Levi Cowwell last week first of all first time we've had a chance to speak to you how is he and how much of an impact will that have on your team this Anyway, now he's he's okay. Uh uh aware that he has to be a long time out. It's a big loss for us. Uh you know uh how important Leo has been for us last season uh for the way we want to play. We said many times that we are able to uh create chances and to attack in the right way if we are able to build in the right way. and Leoi was a huge part of our buildup and now uh he's out and uh we're going to try to find different solution. Is a different solution internally or externally? We are trying to find solution internally but uh uh the club know exactly what I think and we'll see what's happen. What do you think? I think we need a center defender but uh we see so we are looking for internally solution uh but as I said the club knows exactly what they think and with the transfer market I know you said the club are always active if there's no other business between now and close of the window would you be happy with the squad you've got to attack a season that includes Champions League football this year we have a fantastic squad uh we are happy with the squad. We are no doubt but uh we said many times that when the window transfer is open anything anything can happen. Look my final question you we we are building up to a brand new campaign. What are your expectations out of this Chelsea side this year because it feels like there's a completely different aura around the club not just internally but externally. A lot of fans are tipping Chelsea to compete for the Premier League title this season. Certainly that wasn't the conversation last year. So for you, how do you see a successful season come the end of this campaign? No, for me this show how good the team has been this season because as you said when I joined the club one year ago, uh the the noise around the club uh was completely different noise compared to now. uh for many reason uh now personally I always said the same that for me uh I I don't like to look in two month in three month in in four months because that's doesn't exist in football uh I like to watch tomorrow I like to be focused on tomorrow game in two in two days against Palace then in terms of target my personal target the target of the team is to to try to improve every day and then we see what's Thanks. Thanks, James. Alex, hi Enzo. Just following on from that, I'm sure you've heard that Arnold Slot said that he expected Chelsea to win the league last season. What was your reaction when you heard that? This is what Slot said about us last season. Yeah, about Chelsea last season. I I didn't know to be honest. I said already. I didn't I don't I don't I don't I don't I I don't pay attention what uh the other uh uh uh people say about us. Uh also because uh it's easy to say that uh uh more clubs they are involved you know it's it's it's I don't like to play this kind of game. I like to be focused on players try to improve and then what they say they are they can say what they want. How much stronger do you think your squad is going into this season compared to this time last season? We are a better team for sure compared to one year ago and the reason why is because uh we work together every day for one season. Uh I think what the club what the team achieve the first season has been top fantastic finishing champion league conference league that was the competition that we were in the club world cup. So, uh, more than this was quite difficult to to achieve something more. Now, it's a new season and we'll see. Crystal Palace on Sunday at Stanford Bridge. I'm sure you watch the Community Shield. How highly do you rate them? How how big a test will this be? You think uh will be very very difficult has been the Community Shield, has been the FA Cup against City. So, they beat in two finals probably the two best team in the last 10 15 years in England, Man City and Liverpool. So this show how complicate it will be on Sunday. And reflecting on your games against them last season arguably two games that that Chelsea could have won, should have won. I think in both game probably we deserve something more but sometimes you didn't deserve and you get points. So it's football is normal but uh for sure as I said uh the the two finals they won show how they are. You said Wesley Favana could be back in the match league squad at the weekend. Is that still the case? You're hopeful to give him some minutes still? it he it could be available uh and we see him. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Alex. None. Hi. How is Paradia Labia and Trevor Shalar as well? How they are? How are they? Yeah. Yeah. No. Uh Ben is is is in the process to come back. Uh Romeo exactly the same. And Trev is okay. I said uh that was too hot for him. And I just wanted to ask, you were speaking about Levi and he sounds special to you, Levi Cowwell. Uh, but what about the other center backs who are in the squad? Are they able to step up? Are you working with them? People like Bad Sheile, people like Josh Ain Pong, people like Shalabah. Could they play that role on the left side of defense? It's not um is Benois uh is not in the left side. When we build, we beat with the Levi in the middle. It's diff it's different to the player in the middle that in the left side. Last year we played 64 games and we play 64 games with Levi and Tossin. Now Lei is out. The only one that he can do that job well is Tossin. But we have Premier League, Champion League, these kind of players. The rest they can adapt at that is a new one. He never played making three the guy in the middle last season. So it's not about B central defender. Yes, central defender. But he has to do what? He can do that. Can he do that? It's different. It's not just about that. And also we have players that unfortunately like Wes or Benoa, they have in this moment some problems. And this is the reason why I said that the club knows exactly what they think about central defenders.","[{""text"": ""Enzo, good to see you.

Arsenal,2025/26,Mikel Arteta,4wXLgjd3QAU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wXLgjd3QAU,2025-08-29,"Hello M. Hi Gary. Ma. Yeah, Wuk is doing better but it will be out for for a few weeks unfortunately. Um what is it? Is it hamstring? Yeah. No surgery required. No no no surgery. It's uh it's not as bad uh as the previous one. Obviously very unfortunate to pick it up. He's in the other side is an action that um requires full power from him. Then he clashes with the opponent. He needs to change pace again and and he felt something. So he will be out for a couple of weeks. So do you hope and I know you don't know because he's you're not a doctor but do you hope that when you resume club football he might be available? I don't know. I don't know. Let's see how he evolves in the next uh few days, few weeks, repeat the scan and see where he's at. And with Martin, he's obviously been selected for his national squad. What's the situation with him? We don't know yet. He hasn't trained yet. Um and if he does, it will be tomorrow. And um unless he he's doing everything he can, we're doing everything that we can to to make him available, but we'll have to wait and see tomorrow. So that's not definitely not serious injury. No. Well, there's an injury there, but hopefully uh if everything goes well, he can cope with it, but we don't know yet. So with Kai Habits, we know he's had surgery. Is that weeks rather than months before he's recovered? I think it will be weeks, but I don't know how many months. uh very unfortunate, very sad for him. I think he did tremendously well to recover from the previous one. He's never had an injury before and suddenly this happens. But this our profession, part of football, we need to live with that. Obviously, we lose another big player uh for many many weeks. But it was the right thing to do, you know, and the doctor's advice and and I think uh he was very very convinced at the end that it was the the quickest and the best way to to resolve that issue. You did mention the word months there. So it could be months. Yeah. Every time there is a surgery, you expect something like this. So I leave that to the medical staff to or himself to explain in in detail what it was. But um hopefully the most important thing is when he gets back he's in good condition and medium and long term we protect us well the player. How disappointing is that? Three big names, three big important names. He just started the season and we lost three of our main players but um that's the reality and very unfortunate situation. Three very different u situations but that's why we keep insisting like like everybody else. You need a big squad to be able to cope and and sustain the level. And if that's not enough, Ben and Christian, I guess, are still down. Yeah. So, that's another two that we don't know yet. Again, tomorrow we have another day. Let's see how they evolve and there is a chance to to keep them involved in the game. On the brighter side, Eva, yeah, has had a great week's training, fitted in really well. Tell us about his first week here. Yeah, really impressed with him. I heard a lot of things about him. I spoke to a lot of people about him. really bright uh very special energy especially Laura around him and and yeah really willing he's already gathering a lot of information the things that we want to see on that pitch but especially make sure that he has the freedom and the capacity to express his quality which is the reason why we brought him here even more so than you'd heard in terms of his character his personality a great guy yes very impressed with that yeah um so straight in then given the situation with Martin potentially as as a number 10 at Anfield. We have options in that position. Um and that's a good thing that we have this year. So let's see as I said another day and I'm not going to give you any clues obviously. The fact that he adds to your ability to be unpredictable that's that's one of the reasons you you want to be in the Sure. And we have a lot of players now. They can play in different positions and they can fulfill gaps when we have them. And looking at the start of the season that we already have with injuries, that's going to be very necessary. So very happy to to have the ability to do that. Kim Capier, his name's been mixed review before the window closes. Makusen again, you know, he the fact that he's versatile. He's the kind of player you like. You know the answer to that. I cannot talk about players that are not part of our squad. I just ask you a supercomput question before I finish. Okay. Sure. The supercomput uh tells me that um it's the first time in 8 years that the top two teams the season before and face each other so early in the season. It's the earliest for eight years. Is that is that a shame? Should it have been later in the season? Would you preferred it later in the season? Is what it is. We have to play them. Uh they are the the champions. They are champion for a reason because they deserve to be champion. They were the better team last year, the most consistent one. the one that find ways to to win in in many different ways and uh and we want to be that team this year and we need to go to Anfield with that spirit and that conviction. Thank you. Anytime. Hi Mikuel. So obviously you've seen Esa in training for a week. All of us are very aware of his qualities and what he can bring to a team. But from the little we have seen what do you feel he'll add to this squad? First of all his energy. I think um when you are next to him uh you are comfortable. He's got a big smile. He picks things. He ask you the right questions and and then yeah just him flow with that ball and the ability he has to pick passes to drive past people effortless and just to understand the timing of things. Very impressive. I know it's early in the season and you talk about the standards that Arsenal has needing to win every game. How much does tomorrow feel like a season defining game to to put a marker down given how close Arsenal's been in the last few seasons? A very important one obviously and um and you want to continue and building the momentum that we are in right now and going to those grounds those stadium against this kind of opposition is what we want and uh and come from those uh big games winning in a really convincing way. That's the objective. Of course, you got the draw against Liverpool last season. it both home and away. I'm sure you're aware of the stat, but the last time Arsenal won and filmed was when you were a part of the team, I think it's 20, 2012. What do you feel needs to change to try and get that win this time around? Be better than we've been in these games, more efficient and do what we've done with many other stats that we had even for longer before. Just go there and be convinced that we can go to Anfield and and win. And you feel that? Yes, I do. Yeah. Thank you. MueL on a slot's been talking about the subtle differences to the way that your team plays now with a kind of out and out number nine out top. They've made a lot of transfers this summer and they've changed things up top. Is there any differences you've noticed to the way Liverpool play and the way you're going to approach the game? Yes, because I think the individual characteristics at the end is where it change molds or evolves a team and it's clear that a certain player receiving the ball in certain areas with different qualities, the outcome is going to be different and they made a lot of signings, really good signings. They keep a ball in the squad like we we've done as well. So, big match ahead. Tom, describe the United game as a bit of a basketball match. Um and at Anfield there's like the chance for there to be opportunities that you're in control and they're in control. It's going to be a lot of counterattacks and you've signed some players like Victor and Eber who suit moments in transition. Did you specifically target players like that that would be good for these moments where you're going to hit teams on? We have to add values that are players that add value to things that can define football matches. And those two, they had the ability at the end to make the final action in many ways to finish with the ball in the back of the net, which is the outcome that we want in every action that we have in our attacking phase. And uh those should add this individual action, magic moments, and that's what we need to win games. And 27 injuries last season, I think seven players have already been missing this season, which must be a big pain. Does it ever make you look internally? Is there anything more Arsenal can do for those situations? Try and mitigate that or do you kind of accept that it's part of the volume of matches clubs play these days? No, first of all, we have to analyze what we do. First of all, that's for sure. I think in the previous season, we were the we had the best record in the Premier League. the following season we have one of the worst as well because the extent not the amount but the extent of the injuries of certain players especially to Yayazu Gabi Jesus the long-term injuries we have with the hamstring injuries so yeah we have looked at everything we are continually monitoring and evolving the the needs of the players and and the schedule but u unfortunately we pick very diverse injuries again uh that probably some of them were very unexpected hi It's probably something we didn't ask you in recent seasons, but with with the depths you've got now and the options you've got now, do you worry at all about keeping everyone happy? Worry? Yes. No. I think the word is that I care that everybody is as happy as it possibly can be. Uh that's big part of my job, our job at the end to make sure that every player feels that he's fulfilling his potential and he's doing what he loves the most, which is to play football. And uh so far with the squad that we have and the five, six, seven injuries that we already have, we haven't had many problems to to make the squad. But if with everybody available, that will be a different scenario. But we're going to have to live with that and that's why that competition is going to raise the level for everybody. And just one on on EZ coming in obviously on that left flank now. You've got here, Mowki, Martinelli. There was a bit suggestion earlier in the summer and it's kind of come back again that maybe Martin Lenny could be someone that leaves because of the competition there. Is that something you can see happening before Monday? No. And I think Aby's been a super important player for us and it's going to remain to be very very very important. And the fact that we have options with different qualities that's going to fulfill what we want because every opponent is going to require different things. And then the state um the moment the way that those players are impacting the game and and that competition is needed. We have in many other areas on the pitch and is needed especially in the front line to start the game and to finish the game. So I'm very happy with what we have. Okay. Okay, last year in the ASA section firstly Phil at the back there for H I'm M spoke about Liverpool earlier and saying you know they deserve to be champions last year the good team they've obviously added to their squad this year um do you think they should be considered the favorites to win the league this year? Well I think the favorite is always the one that won the previous year and and that's it and somebody that has to come and and take that crown away from them and that's what I I suppose the rest we are going to try to to do. We already started with the first two games in the Premier League and that's the end be better than them. And just just one mai obviously had a hamstring injury last year which for a long time he's already picked up another one this year be in the other leg. Is is that a concern to you at all? Yes, it is obviously a big one, especially when we talk about a sprinter, a player that gets into that zone very often in a football match that needs that burst, that change of uh rhythm of pace um to be, you know, as threatening as possible. But u yeah, we will learn again why it happened, make him stronger. And unfortunately, injuries are part of your career. He hasn't had that many to be effective with the amount of games that he's played at his age, but it's something that we want to eradicate for sure. I think a couple weeks ago you mentioned with Georgino leaving the um leadership group had to kind of be reshuffled a bit. I was wondering would you be willing to say who's in the leadership group now or is that there are a few I think at some point it will come out but there are a few players a few names very happy with the outcome the way it was done as well and I think it's a very good reflection of of the group okay and on you mentioned the way he kind of flows with the ball I was just wondering is that kind of like a throwback to I don't know players you played with here are thinking of players like they're not identical But playmakers who played out wide like Kaza Riski, those types of players, does it make you kind of think of those guys? Yeah, they have a different feel of the ball, you know, and everything glides and moves so smoothly. They are beautiful to watch. The way they carry the ball, the way they take touches, the way they turn.","[{""text"": ""Hello M."", ""start"": 0.16}, {""text"": ""Hi Gary."", ""start"": 0.8}, {""text"": ""Ma."", ""start"": 1.68}, {""text"": ""Yeah, Wuk is doing better but it will be"", ""start"": 3.76}, {""text"": ""out for for a few weeks unfortunately."", ""start"": 5.759}, {""text"": ""Um what is it?

Arsenal,2025/26,Mikel Arteta,Y6rz_rKTU_I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6rz_rKTU_I,2025-08-22,"Hello. Hello. Hi. Kai Havs, what's the latest of his injury? Well, certainly not fit for this match. Unfortunately, he picked an injury. We don't really know yet extent of it. I think we need a bit more time and some more test and after that we'll have more cl more clarity about the next steps. Is it a flare up of the knee? Did he have something similar during the song? I prefer not to talk about the specifics, but yeah, he's not fit. As I said, we need to explore that issue a little bit further and then decide what we're going to do. So, the best scenario would be weeks and potentially sadly the worst scenario could be worse than I don't know. It's well, the better scenario is that he cannot play tomorrow. I would love to have him uh fresh and available and and bringing what he brings to the team and unfortunately that's not going to be possible when he's just back from such a big injury. Obviously he came back really quickly relatively speaking and now he's picked up this other injury whether it's as as bad or not so bad mentally how is he how has that affected him? Well mentally he's in a good place because he's a really a strong boy very committed as you said he had an incredible recovery from the hamstring surgery. Uh I think he never had a an injury before. So it was the first experience really and now he's got a setback. Let's see how bad uh it is. Uh but I'm sure he's going to deal in the best possible way and and as I said, he's a joy of a kid and uh and hopefully we're going to have him soon. Ben White, Christian Nogard, when you had your open training this week weren't were present. What's the situation with Ben? Yeah, Christian won't be in the squad with uh with Ben. Let's see still how he he reacts and and what we decide, but Christian will be out for another week or so still. And Ben as well. Ben, let's see. Can I live at the news conference mention a threeletter word? Essay. Are you going to say mom? Yeah. Nothing to comment, you know, and never I can never talk about any player that is not part of our group, our club yet. So, no comments on that. It's a difficult scenario, isn't it? because Oliver Glasner and Steve Parish have both said goodbye to him publicly. Steve Parish says um the king is dead long with the king. Although Glas said it was always obvious we were going to lose him. He's all over social media coming to Arsenal, but in your usual way, you can't say anything until it's official. No, I can't. Sorry. Just generally speaking, when you are looking to recruit a player as well as their qualities on the pitch, how important is it that you get the sense that they want to be at Arsenal? just generally speaking. Well, that's the number one that that they want to be with us, that they feel something special to to come to us. Uh then the person and that what personality we're going to bring and then the rest comes and uh and I think we've done that very very well in the last few years to create the group of players and and the spirit in the team. And if that unnamed player grew up supporting Arsenal, so much the better. The better the feeling, the stronger the feeling, I think uh the better always because it brings a different edge, a different will and and emotion to to what you do and I think that's always brings something extra. Victor Yarez, was it always a plan to give him just the hour in his first Premier League? Well, depending how the game develop and um every game brings different challenges, opportunities. I think the game was very demanding physically became really really open for different reasons and uh and we decide that at that moment he did um he did enough and we had Kai on the bench to come and and change the game. No car course this time. So is is is Victor ready to go again? Yeah, he is. He's very very enthusiastic. He trained really well this week again. He had another week under his belt. He looks in a really good place. And we're here to talk about leads. So let me ask you finally about leads. Well, very impressed and watching them what they've done in preseason, what they did on on Monday, what they did last year for sure as well in the manner that they did it as well. Uh big compliments um to the way they play to the coach. U and yeah, I'm sure they're going to put a really difficult match against us tomorrow. Thank you. Hi. Can I ask you about set pieces? An area you know very well and you've been using it so well for quite a while. Worked well at all. um when the opposition is trying to carry on challenging and you carry on being successful. How much as a coach you have to evolve and be creative, carry on getting the result. Yeah, that creativity comes from different angles and in every phase of place we try to do that. At Ultrafford, we have many situations from open play as well that we should have and and we could have exploited the situation much better to be much more um efficient in in how we finish actions and especially because then they went the other way very quickly and on that sense especially being the first one which is really difficult because we all pay a lot of attention to that. Uh that's a big resource that we have and it brings confident as well that the team can score goals from any situation. first go home match of the season in the Premier League at the Emirates this weekend. How how how much how important is it to have the what they have the fans on board this weekend to create a great atmosphere and be part of the journey for the whole Yeah, it's always very special. I think everybody's very excited for the first game. It's it builds a a different energy around the stadium. Uh I'm sure they missed it, they miss the team. We have certainly miss our supporters and and that connection. And tomorrow, I'm sure from from the first whistle, I think everybody's gonna be at it and and we're gonna have a good game. This weekend, in the last couple of years, we saw the three promoted sides to go to relegate after just one season. When you look at the size of the club legend, their history and the result against Everton a few days ago, how confident do you think they will be this weekend? Incredible club, incredible history as well. And I've been here long enough to understand the history of of that football club. As I said, very special. One big city on just one club. So passionate about what they done. Uh you know what happens when you go there and play. So yeah, great to have them back. Wish them all the best apart from tomorrow obviously. Simon, I ask you, you're trying to break down those teams that that Sydney has been an issue in the past. How important do you think the arrival of Ni could be for that when you look at what he does in tight space in terms of the dribbling? Yeah, any creative player that can unlock situations and from close situation becomes an open situation. Uh creating that uncertainty, more attention as well in and around the ball is going to create a space in other places. So, um, yeah, having more creativity, more weapons, having the ability to bring different profiles on the pitch at different stages in the game, something that, uh, for sure we're going to have this season and, uh, and that's great. Can I just ask you one quick one on injuries on that session on Wednesday, we saw Yuri, I think, started the session, but left. Is he okay? And also just on on Gabrielle Jesus, have you got any more sort of timeline of when he might be back? Obviously with the situation with K. So, on Jurian, we have to manage his load. Obviously, he's been out for a long time again and he comes from a lonesome injury. So, we had a long week. We have to manage the load on that. So, we have decided to to take a little bit of training down especially that day in the open session. And Gab is doing super well. I think uh he looks uh in a really good place. Obviously, is a massive injury and we need to come back from there in a in a really strong way, but certainly he's in the right place and uh with very strong strikes, I think. Tom, hi Mel. Um, we we spoke after the United game about the turnovers and the chances that weren't necessarily created. You mentioned seven or eight moments, went back and rewatched it and I counted there was 12 times I think in the game where there were turnovers and counterattacks that lead to a major chance. What for you needs to click and change for those moments to create that big chance? Well, a few things. understanding the behavior of the position, understanding what kind of runs and where we have to start, the timing of that connection as well, which is something that in every situation is going to be different. So understanding certain principles where we want to arrive, how we want to do it and then it's about the execution and being fresh as well on those moments to make that decision because when your heart rate is 180 to make that pass is not the same that when you've been resting after a set piece for one minute, you know, so every situation is different, but um I'm sure we're going to improve it. The good thing is the intentions that the team has were exceptional. is now about making those uh little margins, those tunes to to make it more efficient. And just on the transfer window as well, this is your third recruitment head in terms of someone you've worked with that's led the transfers of Ra work with Edu and now Andrea Bura. What differences have you noticed this summer working with someone new? Has anything seemed different this summer and how things have gone? Well, the great thing is the common thing is that ownership has always been the same. They've been super supportive. H we had a really strong board as well. Um very well connected and then yeah the three very different people very grateful to to the three of them and enjoy to work with all of them with Andrea now uh again as I expected someone extremely professional very thorough determined and bringing something different to the table as well. So I enjoy a lot working with them. Hi. Um, a few weeks ago you mentioned evolution and I think you mentioned it again a week after in a presser and um, when you mentioned that you spoke about creating spaces inside quite a bit. I was just wondering when you were thinking about how the team can evolve, how big a role was that in what you were looking forward to this season. Well, a few things obviously I want to express them here. when that evolution make sure that when we evolving we are maintaining the great things that we do and just tweaking and making uh things that can give us big value uh not spending too much time on them and that's what we have done and we're going to continue to do and uh you will see them but the evolution as well comes from the individuals at the end is is about the players putting those players with their qualities in those position as often as possible to express their qualities and I was just going to ask about David Ry as well because at the weekend there was a moment where um basically the ball came into the box and he punched it out through bodies and it's quite a short goalkeeper by most standards but at that point it didn't seem like his height mattered. So I was just wondering what you thought about his kind of stature as a goalkeeper kind of defying um what most people expect. that is very big here and is very brave and you cannot be the tallest but if you have the will and the and the courage to go for these kind of balls that's a massive attribute and then is a is a super athlete is someone really athletic really powerful really dynamic really agile and that's a big advantage because he can time things really well and on that action especially when there are so many bodies in the box to come out and do that it shows one his courage and personality and they want his capacity to deal with with these kind of situations. One from Phil on the back. Hi, in terms of Arsenal's transfer activity so far this summer and possibly with another big name on the way, do you think that the club is really sending out a statement to its rivals? You know that Arsenal aren't messing around and Arsenal were here to to win this year. I think we are showing uh the ambition that we want to do that we are here to to win major trophies to keep evolving and improving every single year and that's going to come with demands and those demands are clear is our competitors what we're doing where the league is going and we're going to be in front just chasing or acting or behind. We just want to be in front of it and every decision that we make in every area of the club is to to try to achieve that. Does that bring any extra pressure to you at all? For me, motivation for me is how can we be better? How can we continue to evolve to win more football matches with bigger margins? How can we bring the people that we have closer to us more connected? And I think uh the players that we already have are incredible. The ones we already signed, I think there are players that going to connect with our people and make them proud and excited. Okay, last two in the as live section. First, Nick the back. Hi, Mico. Can you tell us a little bit bit about Leandro Trosard and his new contract situation? Uh well I prefer not to because you know my duty what I'm really really happy with with Leo that situation has been resolved in a really great way and I think he deserves a recognition and we are really happy to have him. There was speculation he might be one of the players to leave this summer. Clearly not now but do you think we will be seeing a few players leaving between now and the end of the window? Well, it might be a speculation. The good players always have uh options to to go. Leo was very clear from the beginning that he wanted to go here. The club was very clear wanted Leo here. I was very clear I wanted here. So, at the end, good outcome. James, hi. Hi. There is a suggestion that you've stepped up in the market this week in response to Kai's injury. Is is that accurate or were you always thinking about trying to do one more? It was accurate. I think it was uh very clear what I said that it wasn't done. Uh obviously we were very active trying to look at the possibilities that um that could come. Um we are not reacting to anything. We've been very prepared and understanding what we could do and we have decided is the moment to do it. If you do get one more in, will that complete the squad in your eyes? I don't know because to complete the squad we have to see the in and the outs and still a long time in the window. Just finally just watching open training midweek there was that game you played where Martin Zubimemen was playing for both teams. Yeah. I just wonder was that is that a specific way that you look to kind of integrate him into your style of play or am I reading too much into one drill? Well, that it has an element of that has an element as well of of load because he wasn't he missed a couple of training session before Man United with with illness and obviously the the game took a lot out of him and we wanted to manage him as","[{""text"": ""Hello."", ""start"": 0.56}, {""text"": ""Hello.

Tottenham,2025/26,,gF540M9xnRE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF540M9xnRE,2025-08-22,"How are we? How are you? Yeah, I'm good, thank you. Tony shining. Hey, are we? Yeah, we see. Yeah, looks different. Hey guys, yeah, different colors, different hair. I uh No, true. That's That's fair. I actually uh walked out and walked to the left uh in the weekend. I thought, ""Oh, that's not my seat. I need to go to the right."" That's right. Afternoon everybody. We will start with the broadcast section with no embargo followed by an embargo section for 10:30 p.m. tonight. No live tweeting during the broadcast section and use the microphone provided. James Thomas, can we start with the team news and also can you give us a bit of clarity on when you expect to be back as well? Yeah, team news. Um so um Destiny is better have trained with the team twice full trainings and also other trainings just just too short to be involved for for City. Um we want him to train um tomorrow and have another another good week next week as well. So uh but he's in a good place. It looks very positive about him. Um B will will miss this game as well. Uh um and no Keski is out that that's a I think that's that that's a longer one. Uh I don't want to put a time frame on it. Uh so um but um yeah. Now look, transfers your favorite subjects. Uh Thomas, not too long left till you don't have to have any questions about them. But there's been a couple of scenarios this summer that have been played out very publicly. So Tottenham fans have seen what happened with Morgan Gibbs White and then as of very recently with Ebici as they're now choosing to join another club. How much of a blow is it for you when you have targets and the club has targets that you want to sign and something doesn't quite happen and you can't get them over the line? in in general of course you know that I don't speak about specific players um unless they they are at our fantastic club then I'm more than happy to speak about all our players uh um so so yeah so that's one thing um secondly uh and there's been a lot of rumors uh linked a lot of players also players of think oh he's been linked with us interesting but uh where a lot of times where it's definitely nothing in That's part of the business we talked about before. There must be somewhere someone out there I think is is good fun to put the rumors out there. Um but anyway, there'll be a lot of links. Uh there has been a lot of links. There'll be a lot of links in the future. Um and so just to generalize that to make it very very clear, I don't want any players that don't want to come to the club. Um they don't want to come to the club and wear this fantastic batch, then we don't want them here. Uh, I think that's that's very clear. Um, and also pretty sure that the fans will feel the same. If they don't want to put the fantastic shirt over their head, play for the batch, play for the club, um, really enjoy it, no problem. Then we don't want them there. So, um, I think that's that's a key message. What message would you give to those fans though who see those names, probably understand everything you're saying about wanting to come here, but maybe set their hopes and expectations on those players potentially coming. What's your message now to fans considering there's only nine days left in the window? I think as I said, there's a couple of things. It's uh I said it many times, I will say it again. The club is working very hard to um to see if we can strengthen the squad and we only want to strengthen the squad with players that we think is is good enough. We can improve the squad. Um so that that's done from the beginning and that we will continue doing to the end of the window. And Thomas, look, you you spoke about Richson quite a bit. You've been asked lots of questions on him. Started very well under you the first couple of games. There's still plenty of talk about where his future lies and whether he was included in a potential deal with another club to bring in a player. I'm trying not to mention any names right now. What's the message to him when there are rumors circulating or there is potential that he might be used to bring in some other players? What's the message to him? Because I'm sure you want him firing on all cylinders for you when you've got him. Right now, he is my starting nine. He's scored two fantastic goals. He had two top games. He's the Brazilian number nine. He's a he's a very good player. Um so I'm very happy with him. Um Rich, you want to stay? Um I want to keep him. There's been no talks about anything else. He's he's done well for us. Thanks Thomas. Afternoon Thomas. Um in terms of your creative options at the moment within the squad, I mean how do you view that area of the pitch and um you know are the club actively looking for a player in that particular area? Um, I think we uh we just played um the first game and scored three goals. So, so I think that was that was pretty promising. I know it's a long season and we need enough enough players and um players with different um abilities. Um I think in um in some of the players we have Kudos I think is you know got that that spark and creativity. I think Wilson um does it well. I think Matis Taylor can play different positions. We got two good strikers in Dom and and Richie and then Brandon, you know, the deep runner. Um so I think we got um how can you say variation um up the pitch um but again we we look uh out there and if there's anything that can strengthen it and that is in all areas then then um we're open for it. Clean sheet last weekend um and of course you employed a back four last weekend. we saw back five against PSG in terms of your extensive experience of facing Manchester City um and going to the Etiad Stadium and you know um really taking them down to the wire because I think last season it was 2-1 to to City in that game at the Etiad Stadium. What do you feel is the best approach to getting a result there and against City? Um I think I don't think there's a go-to system um or go-to approach. Um that is something we are working hard on of course the way with with our principles uh I think the main thing is that we need to go there and be brave. uh we need to have enough spells on the ball where we can control um phase one and two um I think would be a big big area and then I think it's you know it's it's a team that has been the except from last year I think the four or five years before that they were probably the best team in the world um and there's no doubt that they want to bounce back they definitely been been active in the transfer window if I know P well well enough he'll do everything he can to to have demands but also to push the players and um want to want to bounce back and they'll they'll come flying out. So, uh we definitely need to be good on the defensive side of of the game, but that's not only low is also hopefully being brave in the high pressure. So, I think it's about brave and aggressive is is two key words. I mentioned the game against PSG. Obviously, it was a really good performance for around 80 minutes. I know the result wasn't the one that you'd wanted. a great performance and a result against Burnley last weekend. So, if you were to go to the Etiad Stadium tomorrow and get a positive result, what kind of a message do you think that would send out to everyone, what kind of a marker do you think it could put down early on in this campaign? No, I think um the the next game is the most important game and that is against City, one of the I see one of the three big contenders for for the titles. Uh um we know they're a fantastic team, a fantastic manager. Um so so to get a result there but also with a good performance that will just build uh a bit on the momentum and and the bits we have here. So we are fully confident we we believe we can we can get a result there. That's what we're playing for u to be brave but also extremely respectful uh about Manchester City. Thanks Thomas. Thank you. Hi Thomas, how are you? I'm good, thank you. Um, you stated earlier you only want players to come and play for you at this club that want to wear the shirt, really want to wear the shirt and really committed. Um, in that respect, is it a positive then that the player you were chasing this week who is an Arsenal supporter and has, you know, wants to go to Arsenal actually has looks like he's going to join Arsenal rather than come and join you. I don't know about uh they they whoever the player is, whoever they support, I actually do not care too much about because we all have a past. The main thing is if the player want to come or not want to come. So if they are from Spain, Denmark, Brazil, doesn't matter if they want to come. Perfect. To that end, this summer you've high-profilely been chasing two players, one at uh Forest, one at Palace. Presumably that money is still there for you to spend in the next 10 days in whatever position on the pitch you feel you need to spend it on. Is that correct? Um the correct is that we are in the market and we will look to see if we can strengthen the the team. That's the main bit. Um and that's what we're focusing on. I think uh we need to have some good processory to to work hard to see if we can strengthen it. But again, I've said it before, I think we got a good squad. We got good players. I see just saw uh 23 committed players working very hard, working very hard on the game plan for for Man City tomorrow. And that's that's what I'm excited about. And despite the long-term injuries you have with James Madison and Dejan Kureski and Hummen Son having left the club, you're confident off the back of that answer, I take it that if you don't sign anybody between now and the closing of the transfer window, this club is well equipped to be very competitive in the Premier League and the Champions League. I think it's um I think it's a good question. Of course, we need to do everything we can to to make sure we are as competitive as as possible. Um, as I said before, I think we got um six good front uh players that uh um that I think is very competitive. Uh and across um all the competition we're going into. Um and then Koski, he will come back in this season. I think that's that's a big thing is is probably longer term with with Madison unfortunately. Um and but also pretty confident that we will sign a player before the end of the window. Hi Thomas. It's kind of following on from that in a way and I guess it is it's about those numbers. It's about Cudas and Palinia coming in as the two new faces but then Sony and and Matt's going out. So is the squad really stronger than the one you inherited when you first came in? Um you can say that's uh two players in two players out. So probably pretty similar. Um I would say uh but also as I said I think my first press was that I think it's it's a good squad. I think there's some talent players. I think there is uh some quality players in there as well. Um so probably the same level but I think that's good. Um and then it's up to me together with the players and the staff to to make sure we can compete. Um and then as I said we we do what we can to uh strengthen it. I think you said in a previous press conference ideally every manager would like players in early in the window because you can work with them and everything but is there any fear with this stage I think with 10 days left or so that at this stage where the club is trying to sign players from clubs that at this point maybe don't want to sell them because it's so late in the window. Um I don't know I think in general I think any club want to sign as early as possible. I don't think anyone want to do that uh differently. Um if it was that easy then everyone could do it. Uh um I you know I'm I'm not I'm a positive guy. I'm not that fearful if that makes sense. I'm uh I I believe that uh something will happen. Um I think on tour you mentioned about trying to get the it's a natural process of the recruitment side getting to know you a bit better like you had at Brenford and streamlining that. Where are you at with that? Has that got any kind of further down the line now? I think that's a like that's an ongoing process that is that is that is every day, every week. Um how we do things, how we understand each other, how they understand let's say the type of football, how I see players, how I see the game. Um so that that will only grow over time. Uh to expect it to be perfect in in 8 week time is is is probably uh not realistic. Um but we we're definitely getting closer. Just want to tag on very quickly because it's part of the same thing. I think you said the coaching staff as well, your meetings at Brenford were 15 minutes and and here they're an hour. Have they got brought that down yet? Maybe 57 minutes. So slightly better. No, good processes. Also, I'm I also love to discuss football and uh love to um develop and and get better and that we only do by discussing things. So um I think it's been some fantastic discussions. Welcome. Finish with Georgia at the back, please. Hi Thomas. Um, a lot's gone on this week, but it did start with Christian Romero signing a new deal, so you're not going to be asked about his contract situation anymore. How sort of pleased are you that he's going to be, you know, here for the long term? I think very pleased. I think that's um I think that was a fantastic signal from from the club and of course from from Christian Romero as well that he believe in the in the club and the project and the the journey we we just started. Um so so I was extremely happy with that and I also think that's uh I understand the exciting thing is is to to sign players but I think is as exciting or as maybe even more crucial is to sign existing exist existing that was difficult top players and he is one of the top players and he's our captain so he believe in that I think was a was a big statement and I guess just from your own point of view you know you kind of inherited a tricky situation you've replaced a manager has just won a trophy, but it feels like you've made a really strong start to life at Spurs. The PSG performance obviously burning win kind of from the outside it almost feels like you've been let down so far with this transfer window with only two in and and two out. Do you kind of feel like you've been let down? No, I think uh I think say to my uh say to my players and if they work very hard uh you know and and do everything they can, we can't ask for more. I know the club is working extremely hard um and it's unfortunately not uh how can you say we can't go in wait rows and I want to buy two good players and then uh and then go and walk away 5 minutes later it's a little bit more complicated so uh I see I see the club work hard I see Daniel working extremely hard Johan um Vi um and we're all on board in terms of do what we can do uh to improve and just finally for me the um the 352 formation worked really well against PSG and you've used that in the past against Man City to to good effect, I guess, when you've kind of got a system like that that you know can work. Do you just go with it anyway even though there isn't a surprise element or do you always like to have a kind of surprise element up your sleeve when you don't go into these big games? Um I I trained every every game a little bit different uh compared to but that's definitely on in my mind. uh 352 uh definitely my mind um whatever 4 to3 uh one um and I will take a decision on what we do you'll see that tomorrow uh but I'm always thinking hm how can we tweak it a little bit inside our principles um and then of course systems can do something but principles is the most important thing um so yeah I I will use I said I'll be pragmatic I'll use different system different ways to to win football matches Okay, we'll end the broadcast section there.

Tottenham,2025/26,,EcFJxqs5yDk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcFJxqs5yDk,2025-08-29,"Yeah, blame him. Hey, how are you? At least I can throw you on the bus. That's just that's the that's the inv. Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for your patience, guys. We'll start with the broadcast section with no embargo followed by an embargoed section for 10:30 p.m. tonight. No live tweeting during the broadcast section and use the microphone provided. Michael. Hi, Thomas. Team news. Uh team news. Uh what's the team news? The team news is that uh we got a new English uh national team player, right? In uh in Jet Spence, isn't it? Isn't that team news? Isn't that Oh, you're now surprised. You didn't expect that. Uh you got me there. Uh which I mean actually is Wow. How good is that? So big credit to to Jet. He uh he he truly deserve it. Uh it's been a a tough uh not tough, it's been what a journey to have it as what 24 years old turning 25 this year. Uh being called up. Uh I don't think many many saw that coming. He had a um a good end to to last season. He had a top preseason. He played very well in in three um three games against PSG City and and Burnley. um really giving a lot to the team. So I'm so happy for him. Spurs supporters are very very happy today. Yeah. Why? Because of Jet. Yeah. Yeah. But also, can you confirm the signing of Chavy Seams? I can confirm that we're working very hard to get someone over the line. Um that I can confirm. Um but right now um I'm happy to speak more about Jet and and other players that are inside the Tottenham squad. Okay. There's obviously there's nerves because of obviously other deals, but do you think the fans potentially might get good news later today then? I hope they get good news later today um for for various reason because we are trying to to sign players um and that we will try to do to the end of the transfer window. Uh, of course, as I said many times in these meetings, press conferences, there's been a lot on. Okay. Uh, uh, we are out there in the market really, trying to see if we can improve the squad, but only if we can improve the squad. If not, you know, I'm happy with the players. They're working hard. Can I just get one potential outgoing, Thomas? I assume was in talks with Galipas earlier in the week. Where where is that now? There were reports of a potential injury issue. Can I get clarification? Um the the how can you say the squad uh news is also that Bizuma is can't make uh the game um tomorrow. Um and right now it's the same presuma as Tottenham player. Finally. You have you fallen in love early? Just confirmation. Fall in love early. Tottenham. H Yeah. You know uh let me put it this way. I'm very happy here. Uh it's uh I knew that before. It's a great club but you know get to know player staff fans. So yeah very happy. Charlie. Hi Thomas. And just going back to team news. Destiny Udogi, could he be featuring tomorrow? Yes, he um he could. Uh thank you for that question. Dez will be in the squad tomorrow. So that's very positive for all of us. Just going back to shed um you mentioned how up and down of a time he has had here at Spurs and I know Thomas Tugle said look he ended last season really well. He started this season really well. I just wanted to get an insight into his mentality. um what have you seen from him from that point of view in terms of being able to really ride those sort of stormy sort of seasons really I think it's um I think Jed is a fantastic example for for a lot of players um not only here in in Tottenham but also other places that he everything is possible uh if you are resilient uh and get through the tough spells that is in football and life and and be very disciplined and keep going training well. Keep believing in your own abilities. Keep keep going is on a on a very rainy day. I think that's big credit to him. Um and and a great example um those stories I think we should all um appreciate and um yeah be happy for. Xiao Palinia has received a lot of praise and rightly so since returning back to the Premier League. I know you can't speak about who the club may reveal later on today as a new signing, but if you are to add an attacking midfield in particular to this squad, how highly would you rate your midfield options for this season? Uh uh so you're talking about Shiao. Yeah. So yeah, let me put it this way. I think we we got a very good midfield. I like the the five midfielders we have in or six we have, sorry. um in Archie, Lucas, Bizuma, uh Shiao, Rutri and Papy with them. Um no doubt we have uh the creativity in Madison and Keski which is out right now. So I think that's very transparent that they are out. Um so so of course that's a skill set we need to find either uh in some other players like Kadusa Wilson or or Mati. Um, so I think the the midfield is strong. Um, and again, can we sign something that can prove the squad? We'll be happy. Thanks, Thomas. Ian. Hi, Thomas. How are you? I'm good, thank you. Um, you told me a month ago when we had the very first press conference with you, the one certainty was that you were going to lose games. You haven't lost any games yet. You've won every single game you played. So, does that show that your coaching skills are better than even you thought or that maybe the squad was better than you thought when you joined? I think both the squad is fantastic and I'm fantastic. So, I think that's very simple. No, I uh we have a strong plan to uh to try to win tomorrow um again against Bournemouth. Um got a big belief that we are capable of doing it. Um we're facing a very good team and uh Iola have done a top job in his coaching staff. They just lost what four of their back five including the keeper um for this season and just continue producing good performances. I watched their game live uh against Liverpool. I watched one one more time over the last two days. Uh they were very good. They could easily got something out of that game against the champions. Um they play a very um um how can you say not not only direct but they play uh very you know through the lines and behind you uh so it's very difficult to defend and difficult to press them uh because they go over the top or behind us um or against every team. So they're really really difficult team to play against. They had a fantastic season last year. So we need to show them huge respect uh and we show huge respect in defensive side of the game uh be very good uh in that aspect because I'm convinced we will create something but if we don't run and don't defend and don't show the respect we'll have massive problems tomorrow against boneless. So if we do that come out with that energy and positive feeling we we have uh then I'm very confident that we can win the game but I'm I'm very aware that we're going to a difficult diff difficult task. There are some managers in the Premier League, I won't name them, who seem to be absolutely wedded to one system. I'm only playing this regardless of what it is. And if they go over a cliff because of it, so be it. You seem to swap systems not only for games, but within games. How much is that your philosophy? And how difficult is that for players because it doesn't seem that difficult at the moment? Um I think I think uh the big thing I think I'm very clear on the principles uh we have in terms of how we want to play. So let's say high pressure. I'm big on the man. Uh let's say defending low. There's some zonal principles in defending the box. But also how we want to attack. There's also the some some clear principles there. Uh but then I think you can tweak it a little bit with the systems. can also tweak it in a system with different positions uh and different uh players in different positions. So that that I'm that I'm very open about and aware um and with the coaching staff backing we we hope we find good solutions. Finally, expectations. I mean, if you go into the international break having won three out of three, certain Spurs fans uh will be very excited and especially with the Champions League kicking off. Um, and I don't I'm interested in your your thoughts on a draw on that as well. How do you manage expectations with the Premier League and the Champions League which is going to be starting soon? Uh, that's a good question. Um but right now I'm I'm I'm 100% focused on do our best to to win tomorrow and can we win it and be a fantastic start to to a new season. Uh then a lot of the players actually all of them will go away and play for the countries and uh hopefully make their countries proud and and their families. Uh, I'll take a break and then uh uh then we're ready to ready to kick on again and then yeah, I'm I'm definitely looking forward to what happening after that. Ali, hi there Thomas. Uh, speaking of international callups, Rich Charison's got been called up to the Brazil squad. How kind of pleased are you for him of course, but also how important is it for Brazil to kind of keep the way you guys have been building him up nicely fitness-wise? Um, I think very happy for for Richie. Um I think is is well deserved the start of the season very strongly. Uh three three strong games, three strong performances. Hopefully he can carry into the game tomorrow. Um of course play for Brazil is big and um I think it's good they play. The more they play the the fitter they will get and the stronger they will be. So so I think that's positive. Just a couple of injuries I just want to check on kind of maybe timelines if you can for Buma being one of them and also Radu Drag. and you expecting him to be able to kind of join back in with things. I think Bizuma um one thing for sure, he's out for the next game and then the specific timeline I'm a little bit in doubt of because I don't think it'll be that long. Um um Derson is um on the way back and he is he's been running for a while. I think he should join the team. Is it in a week time 10 days time? I think that's the thing. So that's that's positive. Um, but of course it it is ACL. I'm always a little bit more uh not worried but just aware that it takes time. We've been out of football for 9 months. You know, you need to get in. It's not enough to have a six week preseason. Uh, it need take a little bit more time, but it's positive. Uh, and and some surprise and come back quicker, of course. I think this might be the last time we get to speak to you before you name your Champions League squad as well. Um, in the past, Spurs have had some issues with the European squad and having too many players. Have you got some kind of decisions on your hands over who might have to be left out if the current numbers stay the same? As I understand it, we still have a a minor challenge there. Um so that um of course decision will be made um in due time. Jay, please. Uh hi Thomas. I just got another one on Jed. Um how did you find out that he'd been called up and have you spoken to him directly about it? Uh yes, we got found out that um when it was announced uh there at 12:00. So we luckily we started training 12 so someone came out uh straight after um he as I understood it received a text earlier today. So we of course I I how can we say congratulated him in front of the players and that was applause and and hawks and everything and spoke to him after and said well deserved and I hope you yeah you'll enjoy it. let's u keep up the good level and keep the focus for for the game tomorrow and then go in and and and enjoy being part of England squad and I asked him if he was going in to call his family and he he was about to do that. Um what specific qualities do you want from someone who plays in the like central attacking midfield role whether that's someone new or someone who is already in the squad? I think depends a little bit the game. Um yeah because let's say we play away to city um and I I think dep depend the the game and the other players around because you can have two very offensiveminded sitters um that are very forward going and then you maybe need more of a runner in a 10. uh then you can have three front players where they are unbelievable runners but or one of them is a little bit more creative. So I think I'm not I'm not looking in one specific position what I want from the 10 position because if I what I want for that position I don't think I don't think he it's possible to get him uh because he would be a a running machine pressing machine unreal creative can do headers can put it in the top corner lot of tapins you know that would be the perfect players there not too many of those players so I need to be a little bit pragmatic uh and if we have a very let's say offensive 10 then maybe need a little bit behind If we don't have that, then we need a little bit, you know, the construction of the midfield, I would say. Um, you obviously like players that can play in multiple positions. Does it ever reach a point in that player's career where they need to specialize or stick to one particular role? You think I I think if you if you if you That's a good question. I think when we see players performing in their performing their best most likely to play one position. Uh Noah is 10 a right wing or striker or center back but these days we can see center backs also play to the as as a fullback. Uh some midfielders play 10 sometimes they play six. So so I think it is when they go towards their peak if that makes sense. That's where they should settle into uh to that position. That's not the same that they can't play across a front four or front three. Also, the modern football, I think they are much more flexible now. Uh the front three now need to be playing on the wings, the striker as a tender. Finish with George, please. Hi, Thomas. Um there's a certain player from Amsterdam we believe is on the the other side of the building and you can almost feel the excitement, you know, in in the place and and yourself. It feels like how kind of chuffed are you that Spurs are really really close to signing a brilliant player? I think that we are close to sign someone um pleti um uh as I said just as a go-to make it so much easier I speak about the players that's why I'm very happy that I found out to say that in Brenford and kept it consistently so I'll be very boring uh in that and unfortunately just say I want to speak about the players in house and everyone else in outside of the the our team I will not speak about unless it's Messi and Ronaldo and the good thing is they're soon retiring both of them So that's make it very simple. And and just to go back to last week, um afterwards you spoke about how you really wanted the team to push for that third goal which didn't come obviously got a brilliant 2-0 victory. Is that kind of your natural tendency to always want to push for another goal or is that kind of trying to sort of align with with the club's philosophy which has always kind of been that? Um I think I uh I would always say I had a offensive mindset as a as a coach. um always um yeah try to push to play more offense and try to go for the next goal. Um I I agree lines perfect with the with the club's values and the history of the club. Um uh so I had it, you know, since I started as a young coach, the useless routine coach Burnby, but I when I came to to Brenford actually got an extra notch. I know it's it's not a um a big club, but the the ownership especially in Matthew and and and Phil and Rasmos were big on that. Also, all all statistics, everything said that if you went for the for the next goal, it was more like you get three points instead of you get two defensive. So, that was just a line. So, because there was so big on it as well, there was a lot of good discussions and and and and thought process behind also with your subs. What do you do? Do you sub a striker with a midfielder or do you sub a striker for a striker? I think that's offensive. So, you go for the goal. Of course, you all know that sometimes you maybe change I have no problem changing to a 5-32, but you still have two strikes on the pitch. Uh, and I have no problem to play a more offensive of the three uh if it's possible. That all depends, but definitely will go for the goal always. And um obviously Champions League draw was was last night and I guess a little bit of everything in there. you know, big teams, some familiar teams for the the squad and obviously Danish club as well. What did you make of it? Um, overall I thought um um okay uh okay draw. Uh it's sometimes we draws they can look very bad or on paper or they look very good. Uh but the end of the day is it's how we perform against these teams and we know Champions League uh for every team no matter if it's PSG or Dortmund or at club that is not as big uh whatever um Slavia or or Copenhagen. It's it's the it's the biggest game of the biggest games of the season. So So that'll be tough uh tough. Um of course I I'm happy that that it was Copenhagen. I thought that could be good. I wanted them in parking. that would be even more probably more difficult uh if I'm honest but uh uh it'll be difficult no matter what and it's it's nice when you have good colleagues that you um you're facing them.

Tottenham,2025/26,,8t7f7EAWu00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t7f7EAWu00,2025-08-15,"Sun is shining. Morning. Happy New Year. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. Morning, guys. We'll start with the broadcast section with no embargo, followed by an embargoed section for 10:30 p.m. tonight. No live tweeting during the broadcast section and use a microphone provided. Michael, hi Thomas. Hi. Hi. Um, can I just get the team news, please, ahead of the game tomorrow? Thank you. Uh yes uh every player who's available is um is available for the team tomorrow. Um Destiny is um progressing but it's too early for him to be involved in the squad. So many positives from Wednesday. One negative was the awful abuse Matis tell received. How is the squad? But more importantly first how is Matis? Yeah, I think it's um of course travel what happened to to Mati and uh it's uh we're doing everything we can to to support him um in in this situation. He's a he's a strong person. Um and with hopefully his support from family and friends and us um that that'll be he'll get he'll get through it. Um but also know there's no real Tottenham supporter that they will will do that. Uh the real Tottenham supporters that we'll see tomorrow at the stadium, they will back him and I I expect them to um it's in in tough times. We we step up together and uh I I expect the fans to give him um really really really big u cheer uh tomorrow. Now, I'd never waste a question by naming names who don't play for Tottenham Hotspur, but obviously the transfer window still open, but you still do it. Yeah. Oh, no. No names. No specific name. I think we're aware of the targets. But did you Is that still the pro you think sort of two, three, four over the next few weeks from what you've seen? Um, first and foremost, in many ways, I'm very happy with the squad. I think there's a lot of good players. to think we we saw a team that was very very very competitive and on any any other day we would have beaten the best team in Europe. Um, of course we want as as strong and and competitive squad as possible. Um, I know that Daniel, Johan and and Vina are working night and day. Um, and they have, by the way, been working night and day uh the last whatever six, seven, eight weeks. Uh and they are they they definitely like to to do deals early. Uh sometimes I think we need to understand it's not not that easy. Um but um there is uh they're working. What's the latest with IBAU? He posted a picture of an empty training ground in the gym on the day of the final in is there a way back for him or do you think best for all concern that he finds another club? Where are we with him? Oh, Bisuma, there was um a situation. Um I addressed this. There was there was a consequence. Um Bisuma will be in the squad tomorrow. Um move forward. Uh and we have the big game tomorrow. Thank you. Sure. Morning. Um I want to kick off with Kudos. We've seen the glimpses of the great player he is in white uh defending as well as he is going forward, but we've also seen him play everywhere. Second striker, right wing 10, eight in his career. with your midfield injuries, would you play him centrally as a 10 consistently or you prefer him in the wider areas? Um, I think um depending on the game, the challenge, the game plan and so on, uh, he can play in in all those position you just named there. Um, so I think preferably he's probably right wing 10, can play both positions. Um, but I I like I like flexible players. It gives us opportunities. Um uh but those are the two main main positions. Your Burnley kicks off tomorrow your Premier League campaign at home. Their defensive structure normally five at the back individually manm marking doubling up on attackers. What sort of tactical battle do you actually expect? Uh like uh in in some ways the the challenge can be more more different from the challenge we just faced two days ago against PSG. But I think the level of challenge is the same. It's just different uh from not that much expectation, maybe slightly more expectations tomorrow uh for the game, but against a team and uh had a very good manager and coaching staff have done very well. Last year, you know, we all know their defensive record. That that's insane. Nine 29 clean sheets, 16 goals conceded. you know, I know they go a step up, but I just show that the structure, the discipline, the mentality to to ability to defend. Uh, so that's a challenge we need to embrace and we will embrace. Uh, and we will be positive and we will attack. Uh, but I think it's a it's a game where I see a game picture where where we will dominate and um it can take time before we score the first goal. Of course, we like to score inside the first minute and the roof will go off the stadium. else won't be happy but um you never know we need to be ready for everything and one thing is for sure um that the the the team I us all of us need to perform uh the fans need to perform uh we we can only do it together the fans and the team if they are together it's like energy you know pushing the players forward that will make it so much easier we need we need help of course what's the most important thing you've learned about your team so far you're still very new to the role you're still getting to know your players every day, but what's that one integral thing where you're like, ""Yeah, um I would like to say two things."" Um I know you only said one, so uh take two. Uh thank you. Uh one thing is the is the mentality of the group. I think it's very strong mentality. So we saw that against PSG. Um the way they they they dealt with that game. Uh the way they they worked, their approach to it. Um, I think that's uh that was very good and I think the ability to take on a board messages and game plans because they executed it perfectly. Um, that that's the two things. Hi Thomas, how are you? I'm good, thank you. I want to know, have you got any butterflies in your stomach because this is the first time you're managing a Premier League team other than Brenford? Uh, I will have tomorrow. I think uh if I'm honestly now I'm like in a in a work mode you know LA last planning we have a training in 3 hours uh and all my focus on that and that is how can you say normal uh with everything it's you know different players but it's the same so fully fully focused on that but I know when I wake up tomorrow and I know when I stay step into to the pitch uh uh or into the stadium um that that that that I will feel it then no doubt and you'll know what it's like to be the underdog because with respect with Brenford, you were pretty much the underdog every time you played. Um, so you'll know how Burnley will feel tomorrow. How difficult is that to take on a newly promoted team on the opening day when everyone expects sun out, hot day, you to win four or 5. Yeah, I think uh it's I think every game has it has its own own challenges. Um and the challenge tomorrow of course is that can we get enough tempo in in the game? Can we play quick enough? How do we break down the low block of a 541? Um um and that's I think again that's that focus. Let's keep the tempo. Let's keep the intensity. Uh make sure we put pressure on them. Um and then um in the end um that whole should be enough. You know me, I rarely ask you about transfers because I know what you're going to tell me that the person I ask is not your player. But a breach um is a good player and you might need a number 10 because obviously James Madison is injured. Just tell us what kind of player you are looking for and would someone like an SA be that kind of player as said we we are looking of course uh in the market not only for 10 positions but just to see if we can strengthen the squad and the players we we're looking is only players we think can improve the squad. Um, and I think that's that's the right thing we want to do. If we can pick the right player and it fits, then then we'll do something. All welcome. Hi there, Thomas. Um, you said uh out in um in Italy that you were going to deal with the Bassuma situation when you got back. You wanted to focus on the game. Can I just ask kind of did you have a long chat with him because obviously with Bassuma there's been incidents over previous summers as well and then obviously he's 29 this month. He's maybe one of those players that the younger players should be looking to. I just wondered kind of how you dealt with that in that respect. Um, of course we dealt with the situation. Um, I think the situation you you deal with internally of course. Um, um, so yeah, it's dealt with. I'm looking forward. Uh, there's a is a big game tomorrow and that's where the the main focus should be on. Um, another one of your kind of more influential players, Richerson. It felt like probably one of his best games for Spurs the other night. I mean, how important could he be to you this season if you can keep him fit and available to play like that? Yeah, I I think Richie was was really phenomenal. Um, I think his his hold up play, his intensity, his pressing, his arriving in the box and so it was was really really top. Um, a real and his attitude top top. Um, so uh yeah, I hope to see more of that. Um, of course we're aware of of the fitness situation. That's something we moni monitored closely. That's why for example he didn't play the first first fl I think against rating because we didn't feel that he was ready. So we'll really do our best to uh to help him and he is he's on it. He he's very focused. That's the main thing and and hopefully he can keep up the level. Just a very quick last one on one player we haven't heard too much about Manor Solomon. Um where is he kind of in his injury recovery and also is he part of your plans for this season? Um every player that is here. um um is is is part of the plans. Um Mano is just back from his injury uh in terms of being on the pitches. He he had a part training with the team yesterday, so hopefully he can progress after that. Hi Thomas. Um when you think of day one when you came in to now, are you where you want to be generally? Are you ahead of schedule, behind schedule, on schedule? Um I think we are. That's a good question. I think that will be a ongoing uh how can you say yeah process uh throughout the season um throughout seasons because you constantly want to build and add layers. That's what what I'm big believer of. We had had what five five weeks or something like that. Um that's been really good. I think we I think I'm very pleased with and proud of what the team perfor how the team performed the Wednesday against PSG. I think that that part of the game we showed that we got far uh with the defensive side of the game, high pressure, middle pressure, low pressure, set pieces, aggressivity, intensity, mentality, and now we have another part of the game. We'll be more offensively of course tomorrow. Uh we have to and we want to. Um uh that's probably completely honest. That's that's the area where we are probably not up fully firing yet for various reasons. Um we will have a plan and be very ready for it tomorrow. But I think all that added together that that to do that consistently every game it probably too uh uh that that that will not just be fully firing. Hopefully tomorrow be very good and then it can be the next three games and be a dip and then we go again. It was obviously um a big ask on Wednesday night physically and emotionally. It was a hot hot night in in Italy, wasn't it? I mean, do you think they're ready to go again that same team a few days later or are you going to have to sort of freshen up? But um I think you know, of course, physical demands um the physical demands in every area were were big as you say, also mentally in the heat and so on. Um the players are very very professional. They've recovered well. Um we've got a good good team behind them, staff behind them that that will help them. Um, of course it's always in the situation. How much do I fresh up? Um, that's of course I'm thinking about that, but that can be from the start. That can also be during the game. Uh, I'm a big believer of when needed, use five subs to bring that energy and and freshness on the pitch, but I'm also a big believer it's not it's the third game that is more tricky than the than the second game. And and just one on Bassuma if I can. But was it just important for you to uh establish the standards that you want here early on rather than allow that situation to sort of develop if you like? Um yeah, you can say that but I done exactly the same in in in Brenford or other places where I've worked before. Um I just yeah I have certain standards and demands. Um and as I think I said I think players need I mean that a lot of love. Um um there need to be a lot of demands and sometimes there also need some not sometimes there also need to be consequence uh if the demands are not reached and in this case it was a consequence. Finish with George please. Hi Thomas. Um you've had a lot of lot to get through this summer workwise. Um a lot of young players especially academy players have gone out on loan. We saw Mikey Moore and Will Lenshire kind of part of the first team last season. What's kind of the thinking behind you those guys and others kind of going out and getting the minutes? I think it's important is is that fine balance between uh I think there's a lot of learning training with the first team boys here uh and a level and I think that that that learning from the intensity physicality professional higher level players is is very good uh and also part of having enough players uh in the squad. And then the next bit is how do they the most important thing for any player uh is playing minutes. Um so it's that that balance um and and we thought it was the right moment to get them out on the loan. And just going back to Wednesday um you know clearly needed fresher legs just kind of with the subs obviously last season you know Lucas Berg played so much and Brennan Johnson obviously was top goal scorer. Was kind of there a reason that those guys weren't kind of the first options coming off the bench? Was it sort of sorry uh Brennan and Lucas and Lucas? Um I think you know it was slightly different shape. um that impacted it a little bit. Let's say for Brennan's in Brennan's case. Um of course he can play one of two strikers as well. Um I think Matt has done well. Um so we're going to need a lot of lot of players in different positions with different abilities. Um I think that uh Lucas done very well, but also think I like Archie as well. Um I think that they're slightly different types. Um Lucas is probably a little bit more offensive. Archie a little bit more defensive. Um so that's why that that stage when he came on um I think Archie's profile just fit a little bit better. And just finally, you know, you've been at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium plenty of times, but not as the Tottenham manager. How much you looking forward tomorrow to to walking out and experiencing that for the first time? Oh, that that's going to be special. Of course, uh it's a it's a first first time for everything and that'll be the first time. So that that'll be special.

Everton,2025/26,David Moyes,5nzNYUBs9aU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nzNYUBs9aU,2025-08-29,"Quiet room this morning. It is not many, is there? No. They're going to be getting at that lock with us. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our pre-match press conference to preview our game against Wolves. And we'll start off with Alan Scott. Thanks Andy. Uh morning David. Um winning is a great habit to get into, isn't it? Two wins uh in the two games at Hill Dickinson Stadium. Um great for confidence really. How are you feeling at the moment about it? Well, it was a really good victory. The the Premier League victory was was a great win against Brighton. Brighton a very good side and uh never easy to play against. So to get the first win was great and uh obviously we backed up with a a cup win in midweek which uh you know never easy. any of the cup games are never easy and uh pleased to get through. Yeah, smiles on the on the face of the fans, smiles on the face of the players as well. Um especially Jack Reish. How pleased are you with how quickly he's he's settled in at the club? I'm really pleased because he's a really a real talent and someone who we we're hoping that we can help get back to the levels where he's he's produced over over many years. So, uh he's helped us already. He suddenly got a couple of games back to back. So, uh, I hope we can continue to build on it, you know, get fitter, stronger, and, uh, and get used to used to playing again. Really mean some great the fans are excited with the attacking players that you've got in the squad, David. You know, the the likes of Ilim Manai, Jack Greish, Tyler Dibling, and Carlos Alcaras, you know, all in the same side. I mean, some people would say it goes against the sort of David Boy mantra of the past. Yeah. Well, that's what people might think. It's never It's always been my always been the thought that we we uh I want my teams to be entertaining. I want them to try and score his goals whenever we can, but ultimately the best teams in the Premier League tend to have the best defensive records as well. And we've got a good defensive record and we've got we've had that last season. So, I'm trying to build on on a chance to see if we can score more goals and and know make more chances when we can. Uh we didn't do it in preseason. So, uh, we've had to bring in people who can who can do it. Uh, I'll not be able to play them all at the same time, but, uh, we're really pleased with the people we brought in. Um, just in terms of bringing people in, then you, I think you said at one stage you did want 10 new signings. You've had eight if you include Carlos Alcaras as well coming in on that permanent deal. Are we likely to see 10? Uh, could do, but I don't want to raise all the expectations all the time. I I think for most of the summer I've been saying that we will be making signings. We'll be looking to make uh signings and we and we have done. Uh whether we get anything over the line before Monday night, I I couldn't I couldn't be sure of that yet. And are there specific areas that you are still targeting? Uh yeah. Well, of course, if we're bringing things in there, there's areas we feel as if we need and uh if we can do it, great. If we don't, well, we'll go with what we've got. Would would that be defensively given the I wouldn't say problems, but the issues you you've had there of Well, we we've had a few injuries there, but I just said that we're in the main we've been pretty strong defensively over the last year or two here. So, uh the the boys have done a very good job, but we want competition for them and we want them to to realize that uh you know there's people sort of breathing down their their neck. But, uh we're also quite happy with the ones we've got here at the moment. Um, Wolverampton wonders away from home. Uh, they haven't had a great start Premier League wise with two defeats from their opening two games. What are what are your expectations going there? Well, you're making it sound as if the Wolves aren't a good side by by what you're saying and I would I would completely disagree with that. I think Wolves have got a good side and I think they're the manager doing a very good job and they're developing as a as a team. Uh, they've got some some very very good players. So I' I'd go against what what your question was, but uh look, we go to Wolves knowing that we know we've got a difficult game and we're going to have to play really well to get a result. What you have done though, David, is since your arrival again in January, he's improved that away form, which has been crucial for for Everton over the years, getting points on the road. I know the strength will hopefully be at Hill Dickinson Stadium, but points on the road in the Premier League is vital, isn't it? Absolutely. I mean it was we had some some terrific wins last season on the road when we come in. So I hope we can keep it going. Uh we've been to leads and we were a bit disappointed in the game against leads albeit a decision slightly went against us but uh but overall we're going to going to go into the game at Wolves and hopefully see if we can come out with three points. Just finally for me any any further update on um squad team use etc injuries? Uh no I think I think most things are pretty much the same. uh you know I think it'll be no every every every Premier League team at the moment squad won't won't be confirmed till after Monday's deadline really whether it be in injuries etc. So I think we're all probably looking forward to getting rid of the the window and uh then starting to work with the players who we all have we saw Michelango back on on Wednesday night. Yeah ready to go for uh I hope so. It was good that we got him back because we've been we've been short for recent weeks. So, getting him back is really important for us. Uh Adam's still got a little bit of a problem with his ankle. He's back. He's back doing some training, but we we'll just need to monitor him and see where he is. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Alan. We'll go to wrap up Premier League. David, on on that note, um what's your assessment of where this group of players are right now, given the injuries you've had to deal with, given the number of new faces that have come in over the last four or five weeks or so? Well, I don't think you ever really want to bring in as many players as we've had to do, but uh we always knew this was going to be a summer like it. We can't fix everything in in in this one window. Uh and we can't repair all the all the damage maybe, which was maybe from past. not so much damage but more to do with you know with lots of loan players with people out of contract etc etc. So we have to try and get it all back in order over the next uh next year or so. But uh this window's given us a chance to to bring some players in. Hopefully the ones we bring in improve on what we had last year. That would be the plan if we could do. But I have to say the players who played played for me last year and and with me I thought were fantastic from January onwards. They really did. know their results, their attitude, their commitment and we want that to stay at Ever and it's really important to the club and given the injuries and players playing out of position thinking Ilman played on the right obviously last week James Garners played at left back. How much are these players showing you in terms of their versatility and what they can do for you? Well, I think versatility is a big part of football now. I think you have to be able to play at times in in numerous positions. I think it's it's more relevant in in the modern day football than it's probably ever been. So, uh it wasn't by design that we had to play them where injuries caused us for different things. Ellie is different. Ellie can play on the right or the left. It doesn't really matter to Ellie. So, we're quite comfortable with that. And you've spoken about the attacking qualities that that Jack brings to the club at this point in time with where are his leadership qualities proving to be just as important? I think his his experience will be hugely important. You know, he's he's he's played in in huge games and also played played with some great players. So, I'm hoping that his nouse helps us. Uh and we need it here because we we've got to make sure that we keep a level of experience in the team around the club. Uh I think that's important even being a Premier League team that if you want to remain a Premier League team that you do have that that big level of experience. And you've just warned us about about some sort of complacency when we talk about Wolves. With that in mind, how do you approach the game on Saturday? Well, I didn't mention then about complacency. I just said that we've just got to make sure that the questions come in are giving Wolves the the the due respect, which they are. Wolves have got a good team and they've got many good players. So, uh, we'll go there knowing that it'll be a really tough game. And just finally from me in terms of everything you've spoken about, has this been one of the trickier Augusts in your managerial career? Yeah, I think it has been. I I felt that really since uh we beat Newcastle away from home in the last game of the season last year and since that day I've really been, you know, working uh on on recruitment and I found a really difficult summer for us regarding bringing with a lot of players who haven't have chosen not to come. Uh and we've had to work really hard and putting in a lot of hours to try and make sure that we get get enough players in. At the moment, our squad numbers are still small. Uh but if if things change maybe before Monday then then that would be good. Excellent. Cheers. Thank you. Thanks Richard. We'll go to Julia radio on the side. Morning David. Morning. Um Mansfield was your 500th managerial win. Tomorrow will be your 542nd game as an Everton manager equaling Howard Kendall's record. You know you talk about I didn't know if you knew that stat. I didn't. No. Uh I didn't know them at all. And uh I don't know if that's a good record or not. 500. But uh anyway, I I'll take it. It sounds sounds okay. Anyway, I will do some just you know when you're talking about that rebuild though with Everton and you know hitting that kind of number and equaling Howard Kendall's record. I just wondered how you have found this this rebuild since you've come in as your second spell. Well, look, the biggest thing I I I think about is we've got a wonderful new stadium and uh I think it's really important that we try and get a wonderful team, not a new team, but a wonderful team if we can get that. Uh we're trying to give the supporters something to to shout about. Uh, I hope they realize that we can't do everything right away and we might not get everything right immediately, but we'll try and we'll try and get things back on the right track and we'll try and uh, you know, bring in players who who give us what we didn't have, which was probably a lack of goals last season as much as anything. So, we're trying to bring in some players who can give us more goals, more assists, etc., so that we can we can get a greater goal tally. Uh and as I said, look, we we need uh we'll need to keep working at it. It's not going to be done in this in this window. And you know, even just now, I'm still talking even where the window's still open. I'm still talking about no we've got January window and we've got uh we've also got next summer because of just the way it is to make things right. It's going to take a while. When you talk about that when players are linked to Everton at the moment, people will say, ""Oh, he's a David Moyes style player or or that's not."" I just would thought I'll ask you, what is a David Moyes style player that you would be looking for? Uh, well, look, it's a good question and I'd say I don't think I've got anything which is any style. I've got to say uh I watch so much football and I and I look at players admire them all different types of players but I think it's what you you we think the need the team needs there'll be times when we're saying h no we need a attacking winger you know we need more speed or we're needing maybe more stature or we're needing more pace so all those all those things we we start to look at to see what's required so I don't think it's desolate down to what David Moyes a David Moyes player. I think more more to do with what Everton requires. Everton requires everybody to come with a brilliant character committed uh accepting that you know we're we might not be absolutely correct in everything we do but you know we the players here are very strong and we want them to remain that. So everybody we bring in we want them to have a great character. Harrison Armstrong midweek two assists. he got player of the match as well and and played probably rather like a senior player that had more belt games under his belt. Does that mean alone for him is off the cards? Do you feel he can learn more with you now? Uh well, I've got to say I think that alone alone's there if we want for him. There's plenty of teams who want to take him alone. He played really well in midweek. He uh he showed that he's got the potential to be a a future Everton player. That's for sure. So we've got a decision. Do we think we're going to give them enough games between now and uh now and say even January? You have to remember in January we've got African nations where we only lose two or three players to African nations. So we we've get that in our thought process even in buying players. You know you're always a bit worried are they going to AFCON for example. Uh so because we're going to be losing numbers in January as well. So from that point of view, we're we're uh we're looking at Harrison to say, do we get him some more game time now? Uh do we keep him with us? So it's something we're looking at, but we're really we're really pleased with how he played and he's beginning to come on. So he's looking to he's looking a very good future Everton player. When you're looking at your strikers, you said there you need more goals. Um just midweek it was 14 shots, six on target and and there's been debate about if the strikers need to be more prolific. What's going on in here with the strikers? And do you feel they're hitting the targets that you need them to hit? Uh, no. They're not hitting the targets. I want them to score more often, obviously. But, uh, that's what that's what we have. We certainly don't have the money to spend 65s or 70s on center forwards. We don't have that. And we that's why we we've tried to get a center forward in quite early, which we've not played in probably in today's market. very low low price for a gent for a center forward. So, uh we have to accept that we don't have that level of finances to do to do top end center forwards who might give you far greater numbers than what you've suggested there. Where's Yousef Chimiti fitting into this then at the moment. Uh Yousef will Yousef is get a good chance of going in loan. That's where we're probably going. Yeah. Thank you. Good luck. Thanks Julia. Any further questions in the open section? No. Okay.

Everton,2025/26,David Moyes,n5hkUH0BzU8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5hkUH0BzU8,2025-08-22,"Everyone, welcome to our pre-match press conference to preview our game against Brighton this weekend. We'll start off with Vinnie from Sky Sports. David, obviously it is the first Premier League game at Hill Dickinson Stadium. How does it feel now that it's finally here? Has been a change to the routine this week as well, like training up there a little bit more? No, we've not trained up there this week. We've uh we've tried to put best use of our time as we can at the training ground, but h we're all really looking forward to the new stadium. It's been something which has been in the horizon for so long and and it's now here. So, uh big moment for everybody uh with the chance to be down a couple of times already. So, uh we hope we can get used to it as quickly as we can. Everybody knows that a new stadium is never that easy, but uh something we're all really excited about having now. After all your time working with Bill Kenright during your first spell here and all the talk then of a new home. What personal pride is there that it's you going to be leading Everton into that new home? Well, I think Bill would probably take more pride in MD. I think Bill would have if I was saying so I think Bill would have hoped to add him in the one who who took them into new stadium. It's really sad that he's not here because he put so much effort into it and probably come under an awful lot of criticism at different times as well for many things. But but you have to say that uh they've got to a point where Evertonians have now got a new stadium. It'll be with us hopefully for the next 100 200 years. Who knows how long the the new stadium will be with us. Uh so for many generations, you know, they've got a lot to be thankful for and Bill Kenright plays a big part in getting it going. Would you see it as something fitting in in your own story with the football club? Well, I think in some ways it does because know to be at any one cob in the first period for 11 and a half years takes some doing in in any level of football. As I've said many times, there's a few uh big managers who who've managed cobs for a long long times, but when you get to that sort of level, it's it's very difficult to stay that long at one club. I've had a great affiliation with with Everton over the years and uh I'm very fortunate to be back and it just happens to be I'm I'm back in time for for the new stadium. you know, it could have easily been other other great managers who've managed at this club, but I I feel that uh you know, maybe it was written in the stars in some way that I would get the opportunity to do so. Throughout both your spells here, we've always said there's always pressure to get results of obviously, but is the does it feel like there's that extra pressure to to get that first win at the new Well, I remember last year when I come in, it felt like the pressure to get results to stay stay in the Premier League. Then I had the the pressure of could we win the last game at Goodison. and it was in in the derby then it was no could we win the last game at Goodison as well. So I think I think we every two you go you you can put those words on it. Uh it's the first game at a new stadium. We're all really excited about it. Looking forward to it. Hope the crowd are really excited by it as well. Uh we have to give them something to shout about and hopefully we can do that. I was going to say what is your message to the fans because obviously you want to take as much of that best good atmosphere to Yeah. Well, there would be no point in us knocking Goodison down or I know Good is still there or moving from Goodison if they weren't going to come with a with the same vigor and the same support. I think we've get the best party another 20,000 Evertonians uh in the new stadium and uh no, the club have tried to give the supporters better hospitality, better seating, better viewing, uh more comfort. So, I hope that the supporters, and I'm sure they will, will give that bit back to show their appreciation and uh get behind the team at the new stadium. You played Brighton third game into your return, one nil win down there. What do you expect from them this time around? Well, let's be fair. Brighton are are a very progressive football club who've continued to improve year on year. Uh they they buy and sell extremely well. Their model their model is very good for for what their club needs. Uh and and more importantly, they've got a really good football team and they have at the moment. So, it'll be a tough game. Good football inside. Uh I don't think MD gets an easy game against Brighton and uh we don't expect that this week. Just check on squadwise Michelenko Patterson and how's Brant Weight's recovery going. Uh Jared Jared's uh on the way but not fit. Neither's neither's Moleno and Nathan Patterson's not fit either. So, those three are not available. Azno as well. Azno is is trained today for the first time. So, we'll see how he goes. In terms of bringing in reinforcements. Has there been any progress on on the transfer front? And uh how confident are you being able to get those players before the deadline? I think I'd like to say yes. But, you know, that yes might mean that you're going to push me for for more answers and more questions and what it might be. And but I'd have to say I think we're I think we're trying to make way to get to get more players in. We're trying to do so. uh we've we've been disappointed that we've missed out in a whole lot of other players which have chosen not to come or for different reasons of not being able to make it but I think there's quite a few managers saying the same in the Premier League but uh yes I think we're trying to make progress at the moment will it come off I couldn't guarantee that but we're definitely trying to move on. Is this where I shouldn't throw names at you? No, it'd be wrong because I'm just going to tell you, you know, I don't talk about players at other clubs. So uh that's my stock answer. Just to check as well, have you had any clarification on the ham ball law this week after what happened at Ellen Road? No, we didn't. But I I think generally the feeling all around the country now it shouldn't have been given. I think generally I know there's some people that have said, but I think the general feeling and the word I'm sort of getting from behind the scenes is that it was it was the wrong decision. Do you think it's the law itself? It says in the law not making yourself bigger. Yeah. James obviously isn't making himself bigger. Well, look, let me tell you is I I'm going to say it now. I don't want to talk anymore about it. So, I'm fed up sort of hearing about it and I gave you my opinion. I gave my opinion after the game. We're entitled to give our opinion and uh but it's gone now and we move on. The referees do a brilliant job. We've got really good referees, probably the best in Europe, I think. So, uh I just felt that it was the wrong decision in midweek. Thanks, David. Good luck. Thanks, Finny. We'll go to John Premier League production. Afternoon, David. And we talk about that frustration there at the tail end of the game on on Monday night. How have you been able to to channel that in the correct way to the players to ensure a positive performance this this? Well, let's be fair. We didn't play well in the first half, but we played much better in the second half. Maybe not well enough to, but it really looked as if we could have been on the verge of getting getting something out of it. And when you look at the decision, you might have thought, well, uh, if MD deserved to win the game, it was Lead United, not us. But we've had a lot of games here where we've been quite resolute and stuck at it and maybe not played so well, but got results. It looked as if it could have been one of those nights, but it ended up not that way. Glimpse of Jack Greish. Can we expect to see him in the starting 11 this weekend? How pleased were you with his cameo and and how has he been settled? Yeah, I thought I thought his glimpse was uh was okay. I liked his glimpse. So, let's see where it goes from there. And likewise um new sign in Tiano Barry came on late replaced Car Alcarez. Is that how you see your forward line fitting together? Would you go a betto and Barry up front or I think that the the situation meant that what with nothing to lose really at that time we had to try and find a way of getting a goal back. Uh I don't know if I I would always go that way but I wouldn't say that I I wouldn't do it. I think I've done it in the past but uh no I'm more I'm probably more liable to to choose one or the other. And just finally for me on in terms of the new stadium, is it important that your players just play the fixture rather than getting drawn into this whole fanfare around the pressures about a new ground and all that kind of thing? I think I think we've talked about the new ground for a long time. Even on my arrival in January, I think there was there was the talk even from then, have you been to the new stadium? Have you seen it? No. Have you been down? What's it like? What's this? So, we probably had all that. I'm guessing after this week, we'll probably find it there's less talk about the new stadium. I think for me it's now talking about the new build of the team, you know, the rebuild, all the new things that's going to have to happen now going forward. So, that's it. I think we've got the stadium now. We've got that bit done. Uh, and obviously there's still bits to be done there as well, whether it knowing how to get there the best way or know is is all the the design done behind the scenes. But in the main, we've got the stadium now. Now we've got to find a way of of of building a really strong Everton football team. Best luck. We'll go to Rob at 5. Hi Rob. Um nice to hear you kind of talking about Bill there and your personal perspective the new stadium. I just wonder actually are you somewhat pleased that you get to do this now with that added perspective of where you are in your career and how it might have been different 10 15 years ago. Yeah. I I've got to say I didn't really ever expect to be doing this. I didn't I didn't think that. I actually thought I was looking forward to coming as a as a supporter and a football supporter to to watch the games. Uh I'd been invited back to Gurudison at the at uh uh to come and see some of the games. I looking forward to bringing my dad down. We both do it and then I got offered the job. So suddenly it all all this sort of fell in. End of Goodison, new stadium etc. But also in the middle of that was can you keep Everton up which was was the big bit when the hard bit to do. But the one thing about footballers and even managers we all get a chance to play in all the the best stadiums. Unbelievable stadiums all around Europe, all around the world. We we play in some brilliant stadiums in America. Uh so once you've done it, you know you're on it. That's it. Done. Moved on. Uh if I'm an Everton supporter, I'd be thrilled to be coming and getting a seating in the viewing what I've got for the new stadium because it's brilliant viewing in in all parts of the stadium. And uh I hope we can turn it into a stadium which over many years even beyond me and further becomes some which we we see has been really successful and on that it's actually one of the most exciting things the acoustics that unknown the relationship between the sound and the space and and what that first big moment really feels like. H I think you're getting into music there for me if that sounds but but I think that the the big the big space and the big area will be it's a bit like everything else. I found it a little bit of the the the London stadium is completely different because it's not so close to the to the pitch. Uh it's really important that the the supporters who gather in certain areas I hope keep together and we keep the fan base uh you know strong. I mean, I I had a I mentioned it. I had a brilliant trip to to watch some games in the Cub World Cup in the summer, and I couldn't believe the the the atmosphere that the South Americans uh generated. In fact, it it would have put any of the the Premiership Cubs to shame. It really would have. So, I'm hoping that uh in the future maybe we'll we'll get somewhere close to that. And just one on the squad. Does when you get to a certain position of the window and you have added real quality which you've spoken about, does there become a a priority where it becomes about balance or is that always the case? Are you always looking to get that balance right? Yeah, I think you're right. I think we've we've found now that uh we've we've really gone for some top players and tried to get them and unfortunately we've not been able to get a lot of them. So, we might be finding ourselves coming down a little bit of the ladder to find players because we're we're so short of numbers generally that we're going to have to adjust. Uh we're going to have to look for different options in and different players who who we think can uh can do jobs. And maybe this this is always going to be a year where maybe the important thing is that we we keep steady and we keep ourel correct and make sure that we we do all the right things in the Premier League. Thanks. Go to Phil Radio. Thank you. Hi David, your speech on the pitch at Goodison at the end of last season where you said about the club doesn't feel broken anymore whereas maybe it did when you arrived back at the club. What would you say about the feel of the club now to fans going into this this new era if you like? Well, new romance that we've got a new stadium we can fall in love with. uh that long long marriage means a lot to do with how the team is and what team we put on the pitch over the years to come. You know, can we make that marriage last with the supporters and and everybody at the club? So, I think that we've got that's the next bit and that's why I keep saying I think we'll build a brilliant stadium now. Now the job is to try and build a brilliant team if we can do that and get to that point where where we're we're more competitive than what we are. And uh I'm quite confident we can do that. We get the building blocks down. It's going to be it's a difficult window and it might be a difficult year for us as well, but uh we get the building blocks down and hopefully we can uh we can start moving things along. You mentioned the difficult window. I think it's over2.37 billion pounds spent by Premier League clubs a record for this summer. Has that made it even more difficult than any other window you've had because there is more fierce competition than ever? You could say no, I don't think so. No, we've got money to spend. So, we're we're one of the we have money to spend and we're we're trying to spend it. So, we're we're in there and we we'll be competitive in in doing that. So, it's not that we don't have the money to spend. We certainly have and we're doing that. We're trying to do that. We're finding it very difficult to spend the money, let me tell you, at the moment. And just on that, were you expecting to have more players through the door by this point, or did you always know that it might be one where we're going to have to get some business done late just because of the the sheer numbers that you're looking to add? Simple answer, yes. And uh Jake O'Brien said after the game there were points where you didn't quite look at it. We've spoken a bit about the performance. Have you sort of looked to speak to the players about where you're at? Was that a surprise to you that you you didn't you weren't quite at those levels for leads? Uh yeah, we were we weren't weren't quite there. So talked to the players about it. We've trained hopefully we every game will improve on it. Uh so no, we didn't feel as if we were were at it. But again, I've discussed it. You know, it could have been could have been a different we could have been sitting here saying we' picked up a half decent point. Maybe not not the best. Uh we've played quite often where we've not played our best and taken some from it. This game we didn't take anything from it. Cheers. Phil, we go to the car at the press association. Hi, David. Um, just one on there. You said they you've got money to spend and and you you're sort of struggling to spend it and and players have maybe not you not want to come here. You've got a new stadium. You got relative new ownership. Everton are considered a legacy club. So, what what do you think is is the barrier that's stopping you? Absolutely. Europe, European football having a chance to manage at a club. If you you get European football, you attract a different level of player. You're more attractive. Uh we've we've got we've got to build up an awful lot of trust with with players and maybe agents and different things to to show that we we're a club moving in the right direction and positive. I think our ownership of have come in and helped us obviously know they'll give us a chance to spend more money and look as if we're going to build. But you know I I believe uh you know the better players want European football. Most of them are a lot of them do. So without wishing to put a target in in your mouth is is that sort of imperative this season is get is trying to get into Europe to be able to improve your squad in the future. Well no I don't think it's imperative that it happens but I think that you asked me what why I didn't think the players were choosing. I think that I think a lot of them are looking for Europe. Thanks. That concludes the end of the uh open section. We'll now move on to the embargo section.

Everton,2025/26,David Moyes,ZWUxFy8k0PE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWUxFy8k0PE,2025-08-15,"Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our pre-match press conference to preview our game against Leads United. And we'll start off with Vinnie from Sky. >> David, can we first of all start with team news and talk of an injury to Jared Branweight suffered in training. What's the situation? >> Yeah, Jared picked up an injury in training. So, uh, unfortunately we're going to miss him, but uh, yeah, these things happen. >> Do you know how long is there any kind of prognosis? >> No. Well, I wouldn't I wouldn't give it anyway, but I'm sure the inside the club will give that out. I'm sure of that. So, we'll got to find out who who is uh giving the the news out. >> I take it that's a situation that you're far from happy with. >> Yeah, I'm I'm unhappy with it. I think all managers, you know, don't like it. the thought that uh it's certainly coming from within within our building and it's up to us to to find out and we will do find out. >> Will you have any of Michelenko, Armstrong, and Patterson available this weekend? >> May have may have. >> Uh what are your thoughts then on what you've been able to do in the transfer market so far with the players that you've been able to add to the squad? Well, we're pleased with the players we've added to the squad, but uh I'm not pleased because I think I still need more and we're we're needing greater numbers and uh we want to continue adding to to what we have. Uh we're short in certain areas. We we're okay in other other departments, but uh look, we've got some good business done. Uh but I I would like to have it more if possible. >> For what you have been able to do, and I'm thinking obviously the most recent is is Jack Reish coming in. How's it going to work? How are you looking at playing the likes of Jack Greish, Illeman and Dai, Dwight McNeel? Also bringing Alcaras and Jby Holland to that. What what do you have envisioned for the way? >> Well, I think it happens at every football club. Whoever plays well gets in the the pitch and gets it. You know, you can't play them all at one time. But, uh, you know, if they perform well, then they they retain the jersey and they do that. And let's hope that we uh we get them playing well. If there's anything that we've been missing really from from what we've had over the last year or so, it's it's goals scored, goals created. So hopefully the creative players what you've mentioned there will help me up the numbers. >> In terms of what you still want to bring in, you're looking at three, four. >> Uh, look, I could I could even say even more possibly, but at the moment I'd settle for any of those numbers if I can get it. >> Obviously, it's been quite public the bids that have gone in for for Tyler Dibling. What do you think of the situation at the minute now and the thoughts on the possibility of a deal for Tyler still happening? >> Look, I think like many managers in the Premier League, I think getting deals done has been really difficult. I have to say that's one name you've mentioned, but we bid for many players and I'm not I'm not going to mention players or clubs or anything like that because I don't think it's right when when they've not signed for you or it's we've not done it. So, but we have bid for many players and we've we've not quite get it over the line, but I think there's there's quite a few clubs who could probably say something similar. >> When you yourself are still trying to move in the market, how does it impact dayto-day the fact that obviously you're working with this group of players out on the training pitch as well? >> Well, if they if they do as well as they done last year, I don't need anything better. It's just that we're numbers. We had so many players on loan. We we let one or two players go, so our numbers have dwindled, but the performances of the team for the last sort of 10 or 12 games was was fantastic. And uh if they give me that then I would I would take that. Now >> how do you view this challenge then your opening game of the season going to Monroe? >> Oh tough game. I mean it's a it's a brilliant stadium. It's got a brilliant support. Uh sort of one one club city. Uh it's been a fabulous football club for a long time. I think we were all thrilled to see them back in the Premier League because of what they what they offer mainly because of their their support what they have at Lead United. So uh they've been up and down a little bit. But uh tough game when you go to a newly promoted side right away. But uh you know we we finished the season really well especially where we were away form and uh I hope we can continue that. >> I said to you the other day where you finished the season was European form wasn't it? >> Yeah. Well we we we don't want to set set targets which we can't achieve but but I want to put it right. I want us to start challenging the top end of the league rather than than having to deal with the bottom end of the league. >> And going to Alen Road the chance maybe to see Jack Harrison again. How was that decision to ultimately not keep him on as a permanent sign? >> Well, Jack Jack was great for us and uh done lots of good things, but obviously he was a he was a lead United player. It'll be great to see Jack. He's a great boy and we we really enjoyed having him. >> Also ask you because Daniel Far's just confirmed that Dominic Calbert Lew is joining Leads and that will be announced sometime later today. How you feel about his decision ultimately to go and now that he's a leads player? Oh, well I'm pleased for Dom because you know I've had a really good relationship with him and you know I didn't really get a chance deeply to work with him. He picked up the injury. I think it was at Brighton he picked up the injury and we we only really got him back in the last day. So I think I probably had about one game or two games with with them but we just found the the financial uh financials just too much at the time and uh we chose to we chose to move on. So, uh, it might have been the right time for Dom as well. And, uh, I'm really pleased he's got himself sorted out and, uh, and he's gone to lead United. It's a really good club. >> Since you arrived, well, through a big part of last season, we talked about the pressure of it being the last season at Goodison Park. How does that compare now to the pressure of the first season in a new home? >> Yeah, every season's the same for every manager. You have the same same feelings. It's great if you can off to a good start and we can uh, and that would be the plan. and try and get ourel good good start to the season, get ourselves fixed. Last year it was a poor start to the season but a great finish. So we have to we have to hopefully do both of them if we can. But no, it's a it's a different level. We're in a new stadium. We've got a lot of new things happening this year. Basically, we're building we're trying to build a new team in some ways as well. And it would be very hard for us to do that all in one window. And uh you know, we have to do some of it. Uh but hopefully we can uh we can get a side which was as in which is was as competitive as we were last year. >> Thanks David. Good luck. >> Cheers. Thank you. >> Thanks Finny. We'll go to Damian at Premier League presentations. >> Hi Damian. >> Hello. Just on that subject of the new season in all your years connected with Everton. Do you look forward to this more eagerly than previous years because of the new stadium, the new players? >> I I really look forward to the the future for Everton. It's a we bit trepidation at the moment because, you know, we're the ones who are going to the new stadium and going to the new stadium's never been an easy gig for any team who who's done it. Also, the the turnover of players we've had this year is is huge. But, you know, I'm looking at most teams now in the Premier League. Uh, it used to be past you would hopefully maybe sign three players a season, maybe four players in a in a course season. But I just think because the size of the squads, players maybe not being happy and having to move on uh every year. I think that most clubs I think are signing six, seven, eight players. I think a lot of the clubs are doing that now. So we're no different. But I think the difference was is we had five players in loan last year and that's that's a hard thing to to try and replace. >> Just on the subject of Greish, how's he looking in training? You've had several sessions I'm guessing with him already. Is he in your thoughts to go straight into this >> lead? Looks the same. Big calves. Yeah. Looks looks the same. >> Yeah. >> Is everyone running? >> Yeah. Well, you need to turn up and find out. You know, that's what everybody has to do. >> Thanks, Damian. We'll go to Phil Radio. >> Thank you. Just on Jack Greish, actually, and how he's been looking in training this week. I've been speaking to a few City fans who've been talking to me about where they think he might play best. obviously plays mostly off the left, but they've always wanted to see him have a go in the number 10. Where do you think Jack Greish is is strongest strongest? >> H I think Jack can play in several positions. I think he could play as a midfield player as well. He's a player who doesn't give the ball away very often, but uh but my aim is to get Jack in positions where he can be creative for us and score goals and assist with goals. Look, it's a big challenge for Jack as well, so I'm looking forward to seeing how he he responds to it. Uh the best one I can think of was when I brought Jesse Lingard to West Ham. Jesse Lingard was probably not not expected to be too successful and maybe a little bit worn down and not I think Jesse came in and scored 10 goals in 12 games or 12 goals in 10 games. It was round those numbers he was he was at. He got himself back in the England team. Got back in the England squad for how he'd performed because it was the the games in the Premier League and he showed his quality. If if Jack can can do a little bit of that, Jesse Lingard, then it'll be it'll be a great story for Jack because it's a big year for for England World Cup and he's look no I've only seen him for a few days here live and close up and uh he's looked he's looked fabulous in and how he looks and he's in good enough shape. So there's lots of good things to to like about Jack. I just need to make sure I get it at the right time and make sure he's played football and we think he's had enough minutes, etc., etc. >> And I know you mentioned about potentially looking at additional signings. Do you feel like the right hand side, both going forward and at the back, is somewhere where maybe you're a bit light. >> You should be the scout. >> Yeah. Yes, we do. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. And another question, you know, about right back, you've got obviously Jacob O'Brien who's played there a lot. Do you on the other think that actually you're not too bad for players who can do a job there. Maybe James Garner is another one. >> Yeah, but we we would like we'd like uh we know Jake can do the job there. He can play center half as well. Uh you know, Sheamus is still around as well who we'll use when we think he's fit and ready as well. We've got Patterson as well. So, we have people in the position. So, uh, we may try and get another right back, but at the moment, we'll we might just have some other priorities. >> And I know you said, uh, in pre-season that you weren't completely satisfied with with Betto and how how he was getting on. I just wonder where you see his his sort of efforts. Now, if you're if you're happy and confident that he can get more goals this season with a lot of attacking talent added to the squad. >> I think I disagree with what you said. I don't think I did say that a bit better. Uh but I would always be saying it because I want more goals from my center forwards. We've not scored enough goals in preseason. So if that was picked up on better then it's the wrong the wrong reference. But uh but it's the right words because we want them to score more goals. >> Is Barry pushing him close? >> Yeah. Yeah actually he is and he will do and but again we've just get we just got to ease people in and make sure that we're not expecting too much too soon and expecting them you know young French center forward. I think when I came in, I don't think Bettle was getting a game or very little games. He went on to be a star for us last year and hugely important for us. >> Thank you. Thanks, Phil.

Sunderland,2025/26,Régis Le Bris,va6U7NM56NY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va6U7NM56NY,2025-08-29,"Reggae, could I uh start with Eliza Vienna? Um that big opportunity for him at Burnley last week and it's those sort of opportunities now at this level that you know are critical you probably have to take them. How has Eliza have been in the week since confidence-wise and reflecting on that? I think he's okay. He's okay. It's part of the process. Um, if we think about last season, I think it happened like that. I started with uh uh one or two big chances, didn't score, but finally it was it was really good during the season. So a striker, a player in different positions um can't make mistakes uh or sometimes the goalkeeper can make a big sale as well. And uh stay confident, support him and I think it will be okay. And you're and you're still very confident in me yourself as your main number nine. We'll have uh two or three options in this position. So is it really important? I'm confident. Yes, 100%. And I know that um it will be it won't be linear. It's always like that. Um sometimes he will be confident um can close his eyes and score and uh it will be more difficult um um maybe sometimes. So just support him and trust him. At the other end of the pitch, obviously you've lost Dan Balard now for a few weeks. Um Jensen Seals has been your goto center, but We've got Masawaku um Mi's coming as well. I know fundamentally both fullbacks, but are you looking at one of those to be to answer replacement? Um yeah, it's possible. Um we signed Nordi uh for this quality as a player uh to certain right back position. will have two strong options in this position and um we'll take advantage of his versatility as well. So he can play as a left back, can play as a center back as well. So we'll see. Yeah. Um and in terms of ins and outs, is there any movement at the moment? For ins um we'll have to wait for outs. Uh probably we'll have an option for Ahmed. Uh so we expect him to to leave on loan for the others. It's still the same um principle the last couple of days. It's a crazy period. I think every clubs are waiting just the last last minute to decide. Are are you expecting it to be crazy on Monday? Uh we'll see. We'll see. We'll I think it's important for um three four players in our squad right now to find um a project to have game more game time because uh at their stage of the their career I think playing is important and we had this conversation with them so we expect um them to to find options. Brenford. Then one player in particular I think we know well um he was with you at Lauri. Were you his coach in the B team? Yes and with uh the professional team as well. Um yeah good player massive threat uh in behind. Good footballer a nice guy. Um and uh I'm happy for him because he's playing really well in the Premier League. So Enzo I think knows him as well. So we know his qu uh his qualities, the way he plays uh the way we can control him. We'll see. But uh happy to to see him on the pitch. Know your enemy. It's the key. Uh Jordan Henderson as well probably returning tomorrow. I'm sure of a a good welcome but he's he's been I think in the minutes that he has played for you been he's turning out to be a key player for him. Yeah. Yeah. Really good player experienced uh important for for a squad at that level to have this balance with young players and this type of player. Yeah, sure. And how important is the atmosphere for you tomorrow? It was it was so big for West Ham. If you can replicate that again against Brenford, it's it's a big sort of almost a 12 the old cliche 12th man for you, isn't it? Yeah, it is. And um it's if it's possible to replicate exactly the same, we'll be happy. Sure. But uh um the story is always different. We'll have a different challenge, different opponent. Um and uh the main thing we can control is um us. So the way we will play, the way we will face different um circumstances, uh the scenario can be positive, could be negative, sometimes it's possible, but if you stay practive um fighting till the end uh connected, trying to find a solution to win, I think at the end we can feel the energy of the squad and um I think it's contagious. So our fans are connected with this energy and when we play like that I think we have something more in this stadium Pete from Sky. Sorry nice to see you. Uh just on on the transfers you've had a brilliant window here brought in some quality players. You say you're hopeful of maybe adding someone else before the window closes. Is there a specific position you'd like to strengthen? Is it a forward you'd like to bring in or? Yeah, we still have uh one or two positions. Um but u I'm happy with the the squad right now. Um the amount of work was huge and it wasn't an easy challenge so far. Uh the connection with the new players is really good. The I think they understand the identity of the club. they connected really quickly with their teammates and uh I think we can feel their quality on the pitch. So it's um it won't be linear because you can't start from scratch and being already um effective uh just after eight weeks. It's not it's not possible and but the energy is really positive. When you have so many new players coming into the group, it's obviously going to take time for everybody to gel. Uh, how long do you think it it takes until you fully get everybody sort of gelled together? I mean, you made a good start clearly with the opening game, but do you expect it to take some time? Yes. Um, it's always connected with the opponent. So um if we play uh against uh the best teams probably in the world in this league, we know even with um a well-rounded team experienced with many shared experience behind you, you will struggle. So with new players, you know that it will be difficult but um this is the identity of the club. I think we want to learn um both from positive and negative experiences. And uh when it's negative um we know that it's the part of the process and um we are not worried because we know that we need these experiences to grow. So it's not um we are not happy after defeat was the case at Bern we made a few mistakes got finished and this is the the high level I think but at the same time um we are disappointed but ready to learn and to go again. There's clearly some players not involved at the moment. Few days left in the window. Are you confident about getting moves for everybody and if you don't what happens to those those players? Do you try and reintegrate them into the squad or? Uh yes, I'm confident uh and we'll work until the end to find the best solution. After that the conversation are still ongoing with them. We are not disconnected. We know them as a player as a person as well. So it's really we respect them. We respect the contract we sign with them. It's not just one direction, it's both directions. So um after that we know that um we can involve 20 players. So if we have 22, 23, 24 and some of them won't be involved in every sessions or for the the team sheet. Um but season is really long with many injuries, suspensions, and events. So, we'll see. Just picking up on something Nick said about the home support. Magnificent supporters here at Sunland. I drove in today and there's fans outside the training ground. It's such a wellsupported club. The last couple of seasons, three teams coming up to the Premier League have gone back down. You've got a big home game this weekend. Those home supporters, again, just just following up, they they could be so important to keep Sunland in the Premier League this season. They've got a huge role to play. Yeah, I think so. Uh this is the one of the key pillar of our identity. So Sunderland is made with this support and um if we don't use it properly uh doesn't make sense. So I think um it's connected with the way we want to play. If the fan, if our fans recognize uh the identity uh the willness, the commitment, the togetherness that they are happy, they are more happy if we win. That's that's fair. But at the same time, we know that it won't be possible and every time because the the the level is really high at least if we are connected with this um ambition, I think it will be massive strength for us. And just finally for me on on Brenford, a lot of change for Brenford over the summer, change of manager, their top scorers once gone to Manchester United, Yan Whista isn't playing at the moment. Um will you look to take advantage of that this weekend? Is it perhaps a good time to play them early in the season? Yeah, we don't expect uh any gifts from them. uh well-rounded team um well organized uh good experience in the Premier League now. So we'll face a a tough um opponent for sure. Um it's not always easy after two games to assess um the real identity for this this season. But we know that they have many good players and I repeat they are well co well well well coached um really strong on set pieces direct with good players they can play short passes long passes so good good challenge for us Reggies. Um many managers have many different ways of dealing with a defeat immediately after. Some watch the game back 80 times, some kind of go straight back in. How do you deal with a defeat going back to the Berlin game at the weekend? Like a win or draw. It's still the same process. We want to to analyze deeply the the game from a collective and an individual point of view. uh trying to extract um what is really needed from the progress and for as a manager and a coaching staff um at the end when um we have to find the the priorities because it's always um uh the I think one of the main quality of a coaching staff is to find the the two three four main points to focus on uh and it was the case after Burnley. So we made a few mistakes for me. It's not a big surprise at that uh that stage but sometimes better to to avoid the the mistake and from this um experience. I think this week we worked on it really clearly. I hope it will be helpful for the next game. But I suppose as well that um Brenford will test different areas, maybe not this one. So it's always a long process. I remember you saying in your first press conference that the side will will have to suffer at times this season in the Premier League. Is this the first real test of your side and your squad to see how they bounce back from a defeat in the Premier League? Um yes, it's still the next game. um after a win or defeat uh you always have to reset and go again. Um I think the the scenario was a bit different if we compare the first game at home we had the low possession then at Burnled was exactly the opposite. We created two chances and after that we control possession but not the threat. And um against Brenford we don't know because uh if they score if we score early the game plan and the scenario could be completely different. So I think the the most important um thing in football is to stay adaptive and be ready to to to manage anything. Is it the game plan? Is it um a new team sheet? Is it a new scenario? a decision from a referee. I don't know many things can happen. So go again with this idea to be ready for anything. I saw Habib Diara put on his social media just one simple message and it just said learn and fight. Is that a good message? Is that come from you or is that It sounds perfect and from him. Good to know. Just finally from me what other team news is there ahead of Brenford tomorrow? I know obviously Dan Balard out uh for a few weeks. Is there any other injury concerns or not? No, nothing. Uh yeah, we have uh at the minute 15 16 potential starters. So tomorrow uh we'll start with 11 and we'll finish maybe with three, four, five more uh players to help the squad. Thanks. I know it's only been a couple of games, but how much difference is it playing in the Premier League to playing in the Championship? It's difficult to say at the minute after two games. Um I think um probably the passion and the environment um a bit lift by uh just the league and the and u the focus in for for this football. Uh after that uh it's still the beginning. So we'll have different opponents, different experiences. I'm looking forward to to leaving it. Do you feel like you're learning a lot already about the Premier League? Yes, I think uh as a manager and as a coaching staff we have to to set the tone. If we believe that um we know everything before the start, I think it doesn't make sense uh according to the methodology. So we are and I am exactly in that mindset. Um now it's my second season. So um it's a bit different if I compare with the first one. But the lead the league is really exciting and u the more we face uh high challenges I think the more we can work together to solve the the different problems and the three teams that came up have already all won. Does that suggest that this is going to be a particularly tough season in the Premier League? I don't know. We'll see. Yeah, it's a it's a good point. last season I think uh the three promoted teams waited for in October I think so it was early this season but it doesn't mean that the dynamic will be the same after that so let's wait and see in terms of your squad the players who you've brought in this summer and the players who are already here what have you learned of their quality of the squad's depth from the two league games you've had and the one cup game um I I think one one of the the important point we had during the recruitment process was the the pace and the rhythm. Uh we know that this league is really demanding um according to the intensity, the high sprint load and so on. So so far we showed that um the players who came in are connected with this idea. It's really is really clear. Um after that for the death um yeah it's still possible to increase um the numbers for one or two positions and I hope it will be the case at the end of the transfer window. Uh but I'm still confident because um I like the versatility of um two, three, four, five players. They will help um able to play for example as a winger or as a midfielder uh as a striker or as a winger for example. So just wait three days and we'll have a the definitive uh squad. On on that point there, you mentioned that you could bring in a couple more new players. When the window does close on Monday evening, how will you sit and reflect on on it in terms of making this club Premier League ready? I think we'll know at the end of the season or maybe earlier if it's possible. Um it's still um um a difficult task for for CLM sometimes for manager because we have um two timelines. The first one is um the squad we have and we have to believe that this squad will be ready and work with them, support them, trust them and the other side if we can improve with one or two more signings maybe it can help the the process. So at the end of the transfer window, this part will be closed and we'll have a strong focus just for the development of our squad. And I think with young players and young young team because the experience is not huge um the expectation is higher because um the room for improvement is big. And just finally against West Ham in your opening league match, you did soak up a bit of pressure in the first half. West Ham had perhaps more of the ball. Then in the second you went on to be very very clinical, took your chances really well. Be quite happy even when you're at home for teams to have a bit of the ball knowing that you can hit them when you need to. Yeah, it's always a question of balance and uh I think um sometimes you can have the idea to control possession but the opponent is stronger because they they can control sometimes just one decision um one event on the pitch can create can generate momentum for 15 minutes and u you will struggle because you will concede maybe two three four set pieces and you'll stay in your own half and it's tough to to change the the the rhythm and momentum. So, especially in this Premier League, so you you can have your ideas, but after that, the reality is always connected with the opposition.

Sunderland,2025/26,Régis Le Bris,Qn0A1u7uggw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn0A1u7uggw,2025-08-21,"Looking back at last weekend, time to no doubt reflect and watch the game again. Um, you know, great result and and not too many criticisms I suppose from your point of view, but when you look back at it, what was good and what was bad from your perspective? Um we are always really demanding with the with the group and the players. So uh good probably we were consistent in our style of play. Uh I think uh this togetherness we had last season um was really key for this start and I think we showed this consistency especially out of possession. We are strong, hard to beat and uh we still have this uh possibility in our game to create counter attacks um fast attacks and to be efficient as well on set pieces. So this part was really positive. After that we have many details to improve and many phases. >> Um got the impression from all the players as individuals they look very comfortable in their own skins playing at that level. >> Yes, for the Premier League opener. So at least for this picture it was the case. But um from from the beginning I think the connection with the squad went well uh from I think a human perspective but um from a football perspective as well. So we felt early in the season in the during the preame the pre-season games uh that this connection was um positive even if sometimes the the team was a bit unbalanced uh and layer after layer I think the last one was in Osborg we felt that the the dynamic was positive. >> Jensen sealed how's he >> how is he? >> He's good. He's good. No problem. Yeah, >> you've brought in now quite a few defenders. Um, I guess at the moment it's very much a case of the likes of Dan Ballard, Trey Hume, now Alder's come in, Ray Nielo, it's their places to lose because they played so well at the weekend. Uh, I think we need competition to to be consistent um in in this league and uh we need competition for the squad. win competition for um the position as well because I think we'll we'll need um because of injuries because of suspension but uh probably because of different style of play we'll have to face different options in our squad and should be the case for the for the back line >> and in terms of that competition still lots of speculation about more players coming in where are you at the moment on that are are there new faces still to fun. >> We'll see. One one week to go. We'll see at the end. >> Um Burnley then tomorrow, your first test away from home, but familiar opponents from from last season. Uh do you expect a very different game from Burnley as to to the test that West Ham provided? >> Yeah, so it's always a different story. Uh they enjoyed a really strong season last year. They were really consistent, hard to beat. uh they conceded few goals and uh they were always well organized so I don't think it will be different um for the for the next game and um they still have many threat uh to score goals so it will be different because against um Tottenham they changed their system they might change or they they might keep the same one but at the same time we have a different team with um players who played last season, but with new players as well. So, it's always a new story. >> Um new story, but the three goal scorers last weekend were all players that played for you last season. So, that must be very very encouraging for you that those those players can step up with this new group. >> Yeah, absolutely. And um we need this players to to keep the consistency of the of the project. and they showed first of all that they were able to manage this new uh level but at the same time to to keep um the like the legacy of our previous season. Now last season of course the game at Burnley was probably best remembered for penalties. Um have you established who is taking penalties this season? Yeah. And will be a surprise for you >> and and you feel confident that this this season they will be >> Yeah. Yeah. It will be will be positive this season. Sure. >> Um finally players leaving. Um can I ask about the likes of Pva Bartle? Those players that you've said that you're looking to try and move on. >> Yeah, the it's the the flow of this uh transfer window is always a bit weird sometimes. Uh it's really slow. Uh probably next week um many movements will h will appear. So we'll have different uh options. They want to leave. They want to um to have game time last next season. So we'll see. >> Do you feel confident you will be able to to move tomorrow? >> Yes. I hope so. Hope. >> And in terms of loans as well now you you've got these bodies coming in. Is it more likely that players like Triantis maybe seal will go on loan this season? >> Yeah, it's possible. It's possible. Um, just going back to the Burnley game last season and that incredible finish on those penalty misses. Will he get the chance against Burnley to to put things right this time around? >> We don't know. football is unpredictable and uh I repeat it will be a new story and uh I don't know if he missed these two penalties or if the goalkeeper made two brilliant saves and I think was the case with the even the psychologist background and it was really really positive really good so this goalkeeper left so it won't be the the same story and uh for for Wilson he made a good start uh scored uh uh last week. So, he's in a good spirit. >> How how pleased were you to see at my end of a score, you know, always pressure on attackers to to hit the ground running when you get to the Premier League? >> Yeah. Um I think it's um it's like a rework for them because they worked really well um during this first part of the season with u it's not a new competition but um it's a new story and um you have to reset and they did really well. Um Wilson has had a small injury so did didn't train the full preseason but was ready for the first picture so I'm happy with them. >> Um there's been some reports around John Sumi Lumi, not not sure the pronunciation, but um can you give us any insight? Is that close to happening? And if you aren't able to bring in another defender, are you happy with what you've got at the moment? >> We still want to reinforce the squad uh if it makes sense for the balance. So, it's I think it's still possible in the backline if we find the right player with the right level, with the right mindset to reinforce the squad. still have one option maybe but if it's not the case we'll stay like that >> and finally in attack does that still apply as well with Abdulat that's another name that's been talked about as well from the city >> yeah many speculation which is positive for everyone uh same answer I think if it's possible to reinforce the squad uh with um the right profile we'll move forward but it's it's still um it's not just our question the question of the player the question of the club so we'll one week more. >> Afternoon, Reggie. Um, plenty of Sunderland fans will have been celebrating after Saturday. So, what does Reggie Lee do after a game where the adrenaline will be quite high on the Saturday evening? >> Saturday evening. >> Yeah, >> I don't remember. Um but the the the day after it was the the the usual routine I would say because um uh it was a a good start and we it was really positive for for everyone but it's still three points and we'll need 42 43 44 points so good start but um still a long way to go. Uh so the day after it was the analysis, it was a new training session and the full week to prepare and we are in this mindset. >> The midfield three covered a huge amount of distance on Saturday. I think they impressed everyone who was watching at the stadium live. How impressed were you with Granite with Noah uh and with Haviara as well in terms of how quickly they have gelled together? Um yes, when we planned the the squad for the the recruitment perspective, I think it was really important in our head to find players able want to run because the the request of the demand of this league is really impressive at that level. But at the same time, you have to run but um smart runs. It's not just always running everywhere. So the balance at the minute is really positive with two young um powerful runners, good footballers as well and uh most more experienced player behind them uh able to manage different tactical problems to help to to to give advices and I think this balance worked well worked well for that game but uh I repeat we'll have another problem in Berlin and and after that uh 36 others. >> You broke that record we were talking about last week. No promoted team had won before October last season. Sunderland go and do it this weekend. Leads as well went into I wonder what the next target is >> just the next game. So the and the next problem the and the next challenge is in Burnley. So, we'll do our best and uh if it's possible to to win, we have to win if it's possible because we'll have a strong opponent. They will repeat, they will be well organized and I think they'll have this fighting spirit to open their their Premier League as well. So, will be a tough challenge. Just very very finely, I don't know if you've seen this, but there was a Twitter and ex account Mexico who have decided to choose uh to support a European team, a random European team this season. Sunderland they have chosen to follow hugely. So Mexico is entirely behind Sunderland this season. I wonder how you felt about that. >> I think it's positive for the energy. If we can find support, it's better than the the opposite, I think. Yeah. >> Thanks, Rich. >> Hi, Richie. Good afternoon. Um, Dan Ballard kind of picked up where he left off at the end of last season. It was so important for you getting promoted. He was outstanding at the stage last week. How impressed have you been with him and step up and where do you think he can go in terms of his level? Yeah, I'm not surprised uh by his performance because he showed last season during the play the playoffs that he it was possible for him to reach that level. So for me it's not a surprise. The the main challenge for him is to repeat the same performance week after week. So it's the consistency and it's always the one of the main problem. Uh we have many talented players and no problem for that. I think we can find a good connection between them but the main challenge will be the ability to repeat and to and it's not the same story will have other problems to solve. So for for bad I think it would be the case but it would be the case for everyone in the squad. >> You'll go into this game high on confidence after such a great performance. Burning have had a disappointing start but they're at home for the first time this season. Do you think that also makes it more dangerous with a point to prove? >> Yeah, I think um it's always dangerous in Premier League, so it would be the case again. And to be fair, Bern lost um against Tatam, but they were not weak. Um I think Tatam were really clinical and um so they will be ready and uh and not don't expect anything from them. So it's about us the way we play this game with the same ambition, the same desire, the same to get on us otherwise we'll be punished because this league is u is like that. >> Thank you. >> Um it was a big huge memorable day for the football club last Saturday. Obviously, everyone was at pain to point out it was only the first game, it was only the start. But do you think there's value in what happened last week and just seeing the stadium so alive and the new players seeing what it was like in the stadium so alive and everybody understanding what it's like when sudden win a game in the Premier League? Yeah, it was a good connection with the last with last season to show how loud can be this stadium, this fans and um but we need to win because otherwise uh the atmosphere will be a bit different. It's always the the case. So this connection was really positive and it shows that we can have a huge support from our fans and at the same time we we have to play at that level to deserve this uh this atmosphere. So, it's a new challenge. Uh, we'll have another challenge away. I know our fans will be present in the in the stands, but um, yeah, the the most important thing is to play the the best football as possible. >> You said after the match last week, you said when you've got a chance to win win because it won't always be possible. >> Is that the way you have to a promoted team has to live their life in the Premier League? >> Yeah, exactly. Um so I don't think we'll face any weak teams. So it's always a tough challenge and sometimes we'll face teams with um players who can decide to win the game. So obviously you can't face this uh this problem. Uh so it will happen for sure. So if it doesn't happen and it's a 11 v1 I think the challenge is achievable and it was the case against West Ham. So it was really positive to win this game because it's not easy. Yeah. The goals you scored against West Ham were all very well were very aesthetically pleasing goals and tactically you were very good but in such a league where you know bridge on what Simon said where every point every win is vital sometimes I presume you'll have to win ugly. How would you instill that to your players when of course normally you want them to play in such a a good fashion? >> It's good to win like that as well. Uh no problems. Three points are three points. Um yes because it's always the question of um of connection with the opponent scenario momentum. Many things can happen in football. Uh but if we stay organized uh always hard to beat without giving too many gifts to the opponent at least it's still nil nil so many things can happen from that point and uh it was I think if we are looking back to the this game against West Ham the first half was balanced and we conceded two chances we created maybe one so because we we were able to make it hard to score for them we were nil in at the end at the during the the half time at the sorry at the al time. So for the second half there was a new story because we don't know sometimes the just one event can change the dynamic the momentum and um because football is really impro predictable sometimes the referee sometimes is a player can make bad decision is it ours players is it the the opponent we don't know but we were still in the game so I think it's the main objective is to stay consistent and after that we can enjoy we can um find a solution to to shift the momentum. >> You mentioned that your focus is of course on Burnley the next game, but do you look at groups of pictures in in this league and think where you'd like to be at certain stages and do you have targets for certain points of the season? >> No, it's hard to to manage like that. Um I think it's always game after game otherwise the predictions uh are wrong and doesn't work. >> And just finally, given that you've brought in so many new signings this summer so far, how import the established leaders in this group who are already at the club be in integrating the new players into the squad. >> Um so two dynamics. The first is um our players of the from the last season. Um they were really positive with the new signings and I think it was the case last season was it at the beginning or during the the the winter transfer window? new players were really well welcome from the others and uh it's a really strong point from this team and the second one is the connection from the new players do they want to connect with the the the squad or not and both in both ways it worked well >> yeah cameras Is it?","[{""text"": ""Looking back at last weekend, time to no"", ""start"": 159.599}, {""text"": ""doubt reflect and watch the game again."", ""start"": 162.4}, {""text"": ""Um, you know, great result and and not"", ""start"": 164.879}, {""text"": ""too many criticisms I suppose from your"", ""start"": 167.44}, {""text"": ""point of view, but when you look back at"", ""start"": 169.68}, {""text"": ""it, what was good and what was bad from"", ""start"": 171.28}, {""text"": ""your perspective?

Sunderland,2025/26,Régis Le Bris,tD2BYm_pmbU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD2BYm_pmbU,2025-08-14,"Hi, it's nice to see you. Keep your head coach news. Um, eight long years away for Sunderland since you were back in the big back. How is the group feeling? How are you feeling about the challenge that lies ahead? >> I'm excited. first of all and yeah excited and um ready to go after seven weeks uh the preseason new signings uh new squad um many things to develop but I think the the last two weeks showed that uh we stepped up and uh I feel I felt this this week that um the mindset shifted and uh so we are ready >> 11 new signings a whole team you could feel the whole new team of new signings um more Saturday. Is that is that exciting for the manager or is there a little bit of uncertainty as to what you're going to get because we're all still trying to get to know each other? >> Yeah, it's um still a reset. I think um every season is different because we'll have a new challenge and at the same time with uh 11 new players um it's an opportunity because um we still have to start from scratch um because the last season was the last season and we have now we have a new chapter, a new challenge and uh it's positive to have a new energy, new creativity, a new point of view about the performance and new connections as well. So for me it's it's more uh positive than something that we can regret because um I think it was important to to challenge the squad. >> You said a moment ago that that some notice something maybe changed the last few days. What can you explain what you mean by that? >> I think the the players are connected with the the competition and the way they they work. I think they need uh challenges. they need this uh specific taste of the competition when you are far from the competition. I think the it's not the same fire. So it was the case last season before the the playoffs when the playoffs started they they were ready and here exactly the same. So we had friendly games. They are friendly games and now you have competition and they it's different for them. It's different for us. It's different for for you as well. the club announced this morning that Granite Jaka will be the captain for the the season ahead. Um what was the the thinking behind that and also how is how is Daniel Neil taken that? He was obviously the captain beforehand. >> Uh I think it's really natural because of uh his level first of all as a footballer on the on the grass and uh his experience, his leadership, his understanding of the game. So I think it's really easy just after 10 minutes on the pitch to feel that it will be our captain. It's really easy for player, for squad, for coach, for everyone around the pitch. Um for Dan, it's an opportunity to grow because uh he's still really young, 23, and he has this potential to become a Premier League player, but you have to fill the gap between the previous experience, the previous level and the new one. So for us as a club, as a squad, as a coach, as a manager, it's an opportunity with this new experience, this new challenge to grow and it will be the case for for them. And just finally for me, as I said earlier, you've made 11 new signings this summer. It's been a frantic summer. Really, really busy. Are you are you content with what you've got or are there more signings to come? >> We'll see. We we still have uh one, two, or three positions we could reinforce, but it's always connected with the reality of the market and the reality of the players. So, we'll see. Two weeks to go. So, >> so maybe another five or six. Not >> sure. Hi Reis, Andy Sixman from Premier League Productions. Uh I've heard many a Sunderland fan describe this summer as crazy with the promotion, the way you did it. Of course, a new signing seemingly every week. Just wondered how the manager would describe the summer as a whole. Busy probably is the main one. And interesting, really really interesting because the the workflow was uh really positive. I think uh you can feel it in the in the building. Uh we had a lot of work to do and it's massive uh change and we need to reinforce everything in the in the club to to be to be competitive at that level. So the challenge is there but um the energy is really positive and the collective work the way we we try to solve different problems we try to size different opportunities as well. I think it was a pretty positive experience. >> Massive changes like you say both on and off the pitch as well. You know, there's been some really good news stories coming out. You know, we want this media center with the sign, of course, the mural that's just kind of got up over the last few days as well, Jim Montgomery staff. I just wondered how close you see the connection between the community, the fans, and the club right now, and how important that's going to be in the Premier League. Yeah, it's been one of the key pillars for the success last season. So, I think for for the club, it's just natural to keep growing, to keep um connecting the people and the community with the club and the way we want to play. So, this um this uh part of our identity is so important for the future that we have to invest in it. So, it's very natural. What do you think Saturday will be like for the Sunland fans after eight years away? What do you think it will be like for you as well? >> Uh I hope we will win first of all because uh it's our challenge. It's our main challenge and uh we'll have to step up because clearly the the challenge is new. Uh we have to experience it before saying anything because we can expect different elements. Tough team, tough opponent. uh strong players, talented um strikers and so on but at the same time we have our own identity and we believe that with the way we worked the quality we have we can become competitive. >> I saw a stat earlier that no promoted side last season got a win until October in the Premier League. So how vital is it that Sun get off to a good start and get three points as quickly as possible possibly on Saturday? Yeah, we have to to break the rules. Yeah, it's really important. Last season, we broke a big rule with five defeats in a row and we won the gloves. So, I think it's always a new story and um you can't be just limited with previous experiences. So, it's a new experience and we believe that we can hunt every single point and uh we do our best for that. Just finally, I'm sure you know this, but it was National Macken Day earlier on in the week. I wondered after a year here how many Macken phrases you've picked up so far. >> I can understand some of them, but I come see >> Thank you, Reggie. >> Um, Reis, you touched on it um with Keith about the squad and all the signings you made. How uh happy are you with the the balance you've got going into the first game? Bearing in mind you still have got two weeks of the window left. >> Yeah, so far I think the the connections were really positive. Um we felt through the different friendly games the progression of the the different phases in our game. So it's always a bit difficult to anticipate your future because they are friendly games and against different opponents, different style of play but uh the connection went well and I think we got to know each other on the pitch with this game model with this identity. So at the minute I think the balance is positive but it's always a question of uh um the real reality of uh the competition. So only in Saturday we know >> and it it's clearly going to be a big ask on Saturday. Two areas perhaps. One is the forwards. How concerned or not concerned are you that you you're not prolific in terms of goal in preseason? It's it's almost looking like you're going to have to make sure you don't concede many goals because you're not going to score many goals. don't know. Uh it's always better to keep our our box and our goals safe so it's clear. So we have to defend together to be strong on that phase. Set defensive set pieces as well. But through this uh preseason I think we increased the number of chances we created. It was clear against Hsburg. I think we created six, seven, eight of big opportunities to score. So it's always like um progression start from the buildup then the progressive phase the attacking phase and you have the the final part of the of the pitch and you need confidence and references as well because it was a progressive setup with new players and for example on the left side Ronaldo came late um granite came a bit later as well so I think progressively the connections are getting better and for the final term I'm confident You brought in Alvareti and Masaraja. They're coming in late. You've addressed that left side of defense. Have they come in too late to be involved in the weekend? >> We'll make uh the final decision tomorrow. Yeah, I think it's fair to say that uh and Omar came this week. So, we'll see if they they are ready or not. Is it for for start? Is it for just the final final part of the game? we decide to move. >> Um, you mentioned Daniel seems he's going to stay. He wants to stay. What's the conversation you have with him? >> Many conversations because it's a big shift and I think it's a natural shift. I think um we don't have to to have a big problem with uh this player or another player because it would be the case for everyone to be challenged by this uh this new journey I think and it's a it's more a positive side that we have to to have in our mind rather than I lost my position maybe but uh is it for one week two weeks a few months You don't know if you are at that level. It means that uh here you you are ready to be competitive and to to go through different challenges for the squad but for you in the the competition in your position and I think it's the case for that it's the case for other players and they they are ready for that fight. One more from you. Um, is West Ham a good benchmark, a good barometer for you to judge the level at which you'll need to be at to stay in the league? >> I I don't know because it's still uh tough to to assess the level of the league after one, two, or three games, especially the beginning of the the league. Um, this team will be almost the same than last season. So they have their own references but after that you'll have your fitness level you have your confidence level and they don't know sandal. So um after three four five weeks I think we'll have a better understanding of the of the level but the the team will evolve as well. So, it's a new team. I think we'll learn. Um, we'll struggle for sure because the the league is is really tough, the best in the world, but at the same time, uh, we have to get, uh, every opportunities and sometimes at the beginning, maybe it will be in October, I don't know. Um, but let's fight and see. How does the challenge of staying in the Premier League, becoming a long-term established Premier League club, that is the aspiration, how does that compare to getting there in the first place like you did last season? >> Yeah, it would be different and I think uh we need the new challenges. So, I repeat, it's a really positive journey. Um I want to see the positive side of the challenge rather than being scaled by something because uh if we think about the negative side then we can't move forward. So it's always a positive um vibe and positive challenge. So we have to accept that we'll suffer on Saturday clearly maybe will last 30 minutes 35 45. We are ready to to suffer together and when we'll have our chance our chance to score chance to create chances we'll have to to to catch to to size this opportunities because um this is the level >> and do you see home for being the foundation for your season to stay up to achieve more you're going to have to get those points at home? Yeah, it's always I think it's it's an advantage to to play at home because you you know the the place and you are connected with your your your fans. So, it's always better to to win points at home, but it doesn't mean that uh we'll we'll give up away and because we don't know. So, every game uh is an opportunity to win points. We'll have to hunt every points. It's really clear in in our mind. will no bonus will give us one gift or one point. So it's always a question of effort of uh collective work. >> Just finally are you expecting many outgoings coming in >> uh I don't know we'll see because um we we are ready for everything just to to be clear. Uh we worked well and I think the foundations are strong. It's really positive the the way we work with the the top of the organization and every staffs and I think the the outcome so far is really positive. After that it's a question of opportunities of regular assessments as well with from the the different experiences we have and if we have to make some adjustment we'll do it if it's possible. >> One of the great strengths of the team last season was the the culture the obvious togetherness in the spirit. Is that still there with so many new players or do you have to rebuild that? >> Yeah, it's always a reset. I think uh even if we started this season with the the last starting 11, the main 11, I think it's a it's always a reset because um people people change and uh if you don't uh start from scratch, I think it's a mistake. So it's a new challenge and this togetherness will be really important. I think we showed it for example in Osborne sometimes it was a bit tough and the players were really well connected so now it's would be a question key question uh in the Premier League because we have to show it um at the start of last season the club is perhaps not the favorite to get promoted going into the playoffs club is probably not the favorite to win the playoffs going into the Premier League season you're probably not among the favorites at the same rule >> to to stay in the Premier League Can you prove people wrong again? This is >> I hope so. This is uh really our mindset because we don't know the future and it's up to to us to decide how we want to work, how we want to play, how we want to face the different challenges, how we want to be resilient, how we want to develop our togetherness. So, it's up to us and after that you can't control the opponent. The obviously the level will be high sometimes in this league. I think one player can make the decision if they decide to win the game, they can win the game. So it's the case against the strongest team, but it's already the case against West Ham. If they have talented players, we can make the difference really easily. So it's a new challenge, but at the same time, we are ready for that. >> Last couple building on what's just been said there about breaking the rules, do you feel that the club is still riding the wave of momentum from the end of last season? uh and can you just feel the pose in the city even though you've been at the training ground most of the time? >> Yeah, I think this momentum uh started earlier and even uh after the promotion in championship we the club had the opportunity to go in playoff struggled last the season the season after uh it was a different season and now last season we had this opportunity to to get promoted. So I think the the power of the club is it's really sensitive. You can feel it. And now it's it's not enough. Obviously you have to work and u and to show every season every single day that you you have this desire to to succeed. >> It's easy to forget this is just your second full season in English football. What will you take from the first season will be in the championship and how personally confident are you about this campaign? Yeah, I learn every day. So after one season, I can say that I'm a different coach now than I was one season before in front of you. So I'm learning, the club is learning, the players in squad are learning. So we are getting better and uh we have to to challenge this new level. So we need this I think to to grow. And just finally, given all the new faces you've brought in this summer, is it actually fair to say that depending on the opposition, you will have a team to play and there's not just one strongest 11. >> Yeah, it's it's always a question um a new dynamic and uh we can expect something and I'm sure that something else will happen. Is it for for the opponent on for us? And uh I think it's really important uh to have an open mind because uh as a manager as a club um we can set the foundations and after that we are talking about humans and uh they can evolve in one way and or in another way but uh if we feed the process if we create positive environment I think many positive elements can happen.

Bournemouth,2025/26,Andoni Iraola,j3azx0v3Okk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3azx0v3Okk,2025-08-29,"Afternoon, Ando. Afternoon. Um, I guess there's one place to start, the transfer window. Just three days to go now. How close are you to potentially getting in some new faces ahead of the weekend and of course deadline day next Monday? Yeah, I know that is the talk, but right now in my mind, it's just a spurs. I know that people are working on this, but I've not been thinking in this in these things as a as a manager for us. We have a very important game, very many game tomorrow and my full focus is there. I suppose like in every club there will be movements but they are not on on my hand. So I focus in the in the sporting side and and I hope we can we can play a good game tomorrow and obviously after the game still I think one or two days and we can uh we can uh try to to close the market as as good as we can. One of the names that has been linked with Bournemouth over the course of the last 24 hours is AC Milan defender Alex Gimenez. Is he a player that would add to this Bournemouth squad should a deal get done? I will answer you the same. I always answer it is not our player and I cannot talk about players that play in other in other clubs. You've asked me before about other players and I think the approach has to be always like like this. Yes. I guess I won't ask the same question about Axel Dasi, but another player that's been linked with the club. If you were being honest with the Bulma fans, do you feel like they will see maybe one new face between now and Monday evening? Yes, I think they will. They will see. I don't know how many new faces, but they will see. I think the We are not finished. No. and the club is working on on adding more more players, but we don't know. I don't know. I am the first one not to to know what's going to happen. Obviously, it is a really challenging window. We know that defensive targets are are things you're looking at. Could there be a striker or a midfielder that maybe could come in or is it just purely defense that you're looking at? No, I think the club is open to try to improve the team as as good as we can. If a good chance appears in other positions, I think they will they will make the sign, but I don't know. We'll have to wait. It's not a lot now. We'll have to wait two three days. So, let's see how we how we finishes. And just finally on transfers, outgoings. I know obviously there's a a lot of talk about players potentially leaving. You've seen a number of players leave over the course of the last seven days or so. Are you expecting more outgoings? Do you have any updates on players that are close to leaving? I don't think uh we are going to lose I don't know if maybe one player or I don't think we are going to lose more more players because we cannot lose. We are not uh right now numbers wise it will depend obviously the players coming and sometimes there some things are related. So if uh one leaves one comes or opposite if one comes other one leaves and I think it will be related to to those things but number wise I think now we cannot afford to lose lose players looking ahead to the weekend obviously a huge game for the club what's the form of team news ahead of the Tottenham game have you got any players you're welcoming back anyone that you've going to be losing after the cup game in last week's Premier League match no I think we are in a good case I think we have Luis Cook and Nisal out injured NS obviously with a long-term injury and different case but Lewis I think is doing well and and probably during the international break we can integrate him with the with the team and then Julian suspended because he received their red card the other day. I think everyone else will be available. Yes. How impressed have you been with Tottenham uh this season under Thomas Frank? Obviously he was exceptional at Brenford for a number of years. Uh he's gone into a different club that will probably expect a different style of football. Have you seen that transition? Have you seen a tweak from what he was like at Brenford even in this early stage at Tottenham? Yes, for me it's not a a surprise that they are doing so well. I think Thomas Frank has shown during a lot of years that he's a very good manager and now also has a very good individual level in in in his team. They've also kept I think all the all the players they had past season and they added like Kudos that is I think a difference maker. I think Chavis Simmons is very close players that are are going to to make the difference for them. So I think they will be they will be very good and uh we have to be very ready because they are also very physical. They can play in a in a in a high riding game. They are also very good in in in a slower game. So we will have to to to adapt and I think it's going to be a demanding game very similar probably to the game we played at and at Anfield and um I hope no we are at the level of the game because I think the the requirements will be very high. I was at the game last year away at Tottenham and probably one of your best away performances last season. Would you agree? Yes. Yes. I think we played really well that game. It was I think it was very frustrating that they do we didn't win it because we were even very close to score the 3-0 and after we finished the drawing to two and uh we played really well I think but at the end you see that they always have players that even not playing very well they can make the difference and and I think you need to play very well but also be efficient compete Well, and then you need a lot of things to take something from this kind of a stadiums. Yes. And I hope we we can do it tomorrow. And and just finally, when you when you look at the squad you have going into a brand new season, this is your third season now at Bournemouth. So you you have a good understanding of the Premier League, the level what it takes off the back of the record-breaking campaign you had last year. Do you feel this is a squad that can maybe achieve more success than last season? Do you feel like you have the tools and the players to to push the club forward again? I think it's is is unfair for us to compare us against the past season's team. I I wouldn't want to every time compare against last because there is a big big chance we are going to lose a lot of times. No in this comparison. So I think it's a different process from past season. I think it's a big big changes summer. uh we've lost a lot of very important players that have played a lot of minutes and we've also signed a lot of players. So it's a it's a kind of a revealed and I hope we can h achieve similar things but I think it's a different part of the process. I think it's more like the have more the feeling like when I arrived here that it was everything like new for me and I had to and and second second season it was more more a continuity thing and and this summer has been like about more changes and and but I think changes sometimes is for good you know it's not only know we've lost sometimes you saying very good players who can give you a lot also no and I we have big f big hopes with the players we sign but we have work to do because right now we are you can see that some players the Ben or Amin or they've just trained with us two three days so we need no to integrate everyone whoever comes this last two three days and to make a a a collective unit again no and this will will take the time yes I think brilliant thank you thank And Don, what is transfer deadline day like for you? Are you pacing around? Are you constantly on the phone or are you just chilled, relaxed, see what happens? No, I'm normally at home with the family. I'm not. You think sometimes you are here in the offices in the 11:00 and we are waiting and no, they call me and if there is something they bad, no, I'm not so hands on with with these things. No, no, it's not. So obviously I am in touch and they inform me about everything but it's not like sometimes it looks like we are there is the biggest day of the no and it's not for for me the biggest day is today and tomorrow you know prepare for the game tomorrow and then there are other people that are in charge of of those things but you you are able to just switch off and wait for things to happen or are you pestering Frano come on give me some good news? No, I think we they know very well how I think and you know it's not now we start to communicate and so and I I live in their in their hands now like the the signings the the departures the because we we can help. I am an assistant here. I'm not on charge of the of these things. I'm try to help but uh no I'm I'm not so you know no so no fair enough. Um with Tottenham how different are they under Thomas Frank? Are you expecting a similar sort of basketball style game? No. I I think it's going to be different. I think it's going to be different. I think um the approach is different. Thomas Frank's teams are always very well organized. I I I loved also how played with them probably season was difficult for them because a lot of injuries, different circumstances, but I think it's going to be different now. The the approach is is different and I think they've started really well. Two games, two wins, they haven't even conceded a goal. So I know it's going to be difficult. Erh but I no I don't expect so open games. No I think it's it's going to be a fast pace because they are quite physical. We are also physical. So we have to be ready to run like we run at Anfield and could be this kind of spaces and transitions but also could be a different game because uh they are also ready no and and and sometimes they they make a different different approaches. Thomas Frank has an excellent record against you personally. Yes. From the outside, Tottenham and Brenford look like two very different teams. Can you see things in Thomas Frank's Tottenham that have caused you particular problems before? No, against against Vford probably the worst game we've played was the other day and it was not Thomas Frank in charge I think. No, I think even past seasons against both games I finished quite happy how we played. But we we didn't win. But I think we were we were especially away. I remember that game. We played we played well. But no, I think it's completely different also how they are playing comparing to Brenford. No, they are now dictating the games much more the the first day especially at home against Barley they were dominant and then they won 3 f not easy. is never is in the Premier League but solid performance. I think the other references City PSG could be tricky. They've done very well but are different games. It's not we are not City or PSG you know it's probably the reference will be more the the the game they played against against Burnley but they are very good. They were very good per season and and I think they are going to be for sure better this season. Yes. In terms of your team news, have Ryan and Justin reacted well to having 30 minutes of Premier League and a start in midweek. I think they needed the minutes. I think they still need more minutes. They haven't done a proper preseason. Especially Especially Ryan. Ryan comes I think last game he played starting probably I don't know if it's probably March or even before. I don't know. So but it's good to have him with us. uh because he gives us quality minutes and he will improve every game he plays he will be better and Justin has been a shorter period but it's a it's a important period always precision no I think he's a player that normally doesn't take a lot to get in in form sometime players need because they are more heavy or because they they need more training more I think he's quite sharp naturally and I hope no because I think he was also quite good the other day that he's he's already at at a good level to help us. If Ryan plays, it will be his 100th Premier League appearance. And I wondered if you could take us back to when you arrived because he'd been a number 10, played out on the wing a bit. Was it what did you see in him to make him this pressing monster, this number eight? Was it there was an element of injuries at the time and perhaps trying to find solutions, but did you see something in particular that said no no he can be the general in the middle? Yes, this was I think with us I don't remember him playing any minute as a winger even from the beginning when we arrived I think even precision even I think straight away we could see that we preferred him in our system in one of the inside positions. I I remember him we started putting him more forward in the number 10 role and then after some weeks but even in preseason we tried sometimes in the number eight and we've seen mostly in those two positions. No, I think and and the the previous experiences I think have shown us that he's very comfortable there in the number eight positions and is is our our idea is good that he could in an urgency go over other positions but I think he understands the game very well and when you understand the game you play in the middle and I think there is a bit of advantage because you can correct not only yourself or not just your closest teammate but overall the structure of the team And I'm I'm very happy now that he's returning to the team. Yes. He was also a captain on Tuesday. I don't know if that's been how often that's but is that a role that he naturally sort of gravitated towards or is that is have you seen that element of his game? No. I I feel that I don't give so much importance that you do to this captain armand because I feel here is something very important and for me you know it's it's you can be a captain without the armband you can be a leader you can be a it's not like know we have one captain and we are going behind him and he will no for me doesn't work like this no I think it's a matter of he was I think probably one of the players with more time here. He has this also leadership role. But I'm not giving so much importance that I feel you you give here to the to the to the armband. Yes.","[{""text"": ""Afternoon, Ando. Afternoon.

Bournemouth,2025/26,Andoni Iraola,ql6xRGYdurg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql6xRGYdurg,2025-08-22,"Good afternoon and um we'll start with the the big positive news, the signing of Amin Adley that was confirmed by the football club yesterday morning. Uh a winner, someone who knows how to win silverware, someone that's played in the Champions League, someone that's been described as, you know, perfect for your style, your team. How exciting a signing is this? And and what will Amin bring to Bournemouth? I'm I'm really happy to have him here. I think he's an established player. Even if still good age, I think still young. He has some experience as you said, he has some titles that is always difficult for us know to to sign players that have have won important things. And I also have very good references about his character, his work rate, his his honesty. The the first impression talking to him also have been very good because he understands the game. when you start talking about the tactics about this you you feel like he's he's he's ready and he speaks English very well he can cover I think also different positions in our system and obviously he will need like all the other players some time to adapt but I think with his experience his personality I think I hope no it's it's less time than than in other cases probably certainly feels like an exciting player The fans are excited by the work that you've done so far in the window despite selling players. The big question for the fans will be who next? What are the positions are you looking to recruit for between now and when the window shuts next week? I I don't know how it's going to finish. No, it's true that we are probably you ask me one position you are looking probably is a a central defender. We've been no with the center backs. No, all the all the market I think is is good that Bafod could could play the the other day, but it's probably like a and then you have to be open. You have to be open because you never know what chances are going to appear in the in the market and the club will be will be ready know to improve the to improve the squad. Yes. One player you've been linked with is Axel Deassi. Is he someone you're aware of? someone that you think could fit into your squad. I will answer you the same. I answer every time you ask me about other players are not our players. We cannot talk about players from other other clubs. I think we have to be very very respectful with with these things. One player that's been linked potentially out of the club is James Hill. One year left on his current contract. Leads United are reportedly interested in him. Would you like to keep him at the football club or is this a decision that maybe has to be made by Thiago and Simon because of his contractual situation? No, I have no news about this is new for me is is news and I'm very happy with James Hill and definitely I want to keep him. Yes. Yes. Yes. No, I don't know. cannot guarantee anything because this you know like other players you want to keep them but if someone comes and pays the money that the club thinks that work for every part he will leave like the others but from my side he play the first day some minutes and he's a he's a player that I value yes it's always hard to predict what will happen in the window because you never know what phone call will come in but if you were to say new faces for Bulma fans maybe what one two three more I I don't know. I I not focus even on this. I focus in in the game tomorrow and I know that the market is open and everything is about the market. But I spend very little time now on the market especially when the competition has started. Even preseason you have your work to do and but you try to help more now that we've already played one game. We have I they tell me things that I'm not, you know, I'm not spending a lot of time with the with the market to be honest. Obviously hugely exciting first game at the Vitality Stadium, brand new season, particularly off the performance at Anfield, which was so strong in so many ways. What have you learned about your side perhaps since that game that you didn't know in preseason ahead of this first home match of a brand new season? I think it was a overall a good game from our side. I think we probably from the games we played against Liverpool this years probably was the one we've been closer to get something from the game but everything cannot be positive at the end we conceded four goals and and I think past season we didn't concede four goals in any game all the season so we were we were close I think 3-0 we lost also in Anfield but there are things we need to improve if we want to to especially against these teams no get points and be competitive things that we have to get better but it's not nothing is normal normal first game of the season the four defenders first time they play together so uh things that we we need to improve like I suppose every team now in in this moment but overall it was a a very good game from our side yes talking of conceding four goals Wolves conceded four goals against Manchester City you probably both had two of the toughest games you could have on your opening match and Wolves don't have a good record in August. They've won one of 22 matches whilst they've been in the Premier League. Is this Can you learn anything from that Man City game? Can you take anything from that ahead of this match? I think they different to our game in a different way, but I think they were much better than a 4-nil also. I think they even score a goal that you go one nil up and it was okay. It was slightly offside you these things of the VA but you they scored the first goal and maybe we are talking about other things in that game. you know and and the city goals really they are top level individual skills you know you see analyze every goal and for probably they would have scored that goal against most of the teams because they they were brilliant no so I expect them really tough we have the experience against them here it's a strange matchup because I think we've lost the last three games here in the league against them we've won the last three games away against them so it's I even we have the exper experience of the cup game where I think we played really well and we had to go to penalties to beat them. So I expect a very level game. I expect a level game and I think we we need to to be very good. We my concern is especially defensively to be solid because we we normally have chances. We have good offensive uh volume normally and and I hope defensively we can we can be solid tomorrow. They've obviously lost a number of players over the course of this summer. Do you still feel like they have dangerous individuals that can hurt you? Obviously, Strand Larsson's got four and four away from home uh when you look at the back end of the season, so he's a player that could still hurt you. Do you feel like there are a danger there? Yes. No, Lassen is a very good player. I know him very well. Even from the my La Liga years in Spain back when he was playing for Selta, he was very good and passes on heas. I remember two goals there away even if we won the game and he's a he's very good player. He's a probably the one know you like for the goals and this you have to pay more attention but they have very good players. They've signed also areas fope good number 10 with Moniar this players around him different characteristics and new wax also. So they will have this uh like us in some positions still new players and I think we are two teams that we've lost important players and now we have to h to adapt as quickly as we can no and to to to be competitive. And just finally for me obviously we saw Antoon's goals at Anfield last week. We know what happened during the match. I think the way he responded during the game shows you all about his characteristics. Has he been okay this week post what's happened and and the subsequent um outcomes with regards to to the bloke being charged? Yes, I think his behavior overall from the moment he received the abuse to to now I think has been amazing. I think to take the the things the way he he took it. He explained the situation calmly to a referee after to the to a teammates to ads. He follow he focused on on the game. He obviously played very well and I saw him probably after the game a little bit down and a little bit probably overthinking and is normal but has been training normally this week and and I think has been a a lesson a lesson for because I think his attitude has been has been very good. Yes. And then just finally for me team news ahead of the weekend any players that you're welcoming back anyone that you're concerned you don't have? I think Ryan Christie has trained with us all the all the week. So I hope he's with us. I still have last training today this afternoon and and I want to make I hope he's he's with us and then Justin has done some things with us. Some things I think is going to be more difficult and Ryan Christie but at least good news that he has started doing things with the group and and he's he's looking fine. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Can I ask you about Ben Do, how excited you are about his signing? Yes, Ben I think is a player that even if he hasn't played in the in the Premier League, know you've seen him play a lot. No, because with the national team with the the time that he spent with Middlesbrough and a he's a poor winger. He has the threat one against one. I think he's um he's confident, he's brave, and I think it's it's it's going to be a very very good signing. No, I think now with uh this this these two signings with Amin with um with Ben kind of we are replacing Dango and and Sini that they are going to be out. So it's numbers wise is is more or less the same. No, we had the Pision but different different characteristics. the four of them very good players and I hope with I mean and and and Ben I think we have more more versatility we can try different things and I'm I'm very happy. Yes, you demand a lot from your wingers. How how much sort of integration do they need to to learn what you demand from a winger and how much do you sort of tweak your plans to help them sort of kick off? No, I think our wingers, it's true that we demand a lot, but it's not so difficult what they have to do at the end. We have to put them in the best offensive position we can, and then they have to make the difference, and they have to to be brave to go against their man to to finish as many players as as they can. Obviously, they will have their defensive requirements. Probably we have more difficult positions. No, if you are telling me the eight, the 10, the ones in the middle, normally they have they have to read more the game and it's more difficult to play. No, I think they will have to adapt also. I would like like almost every winger we have. No, even if you have your preferred side, I like to change a little bit. No. And I I think uh they are probably more suited to play in the right, but I would like them to also sometimes play on the left. and we can combine and try to find the the best matchups outside and h but we have now a good time to to adapt to them and also to know where they are more comfortable what kind of balls they they can receive and and damage the opposition and I think are different Ben and and and Amin but it's it's very good to have them. Yes. I think you did that switching last week at Anfield, didn't you? Tell me about David Brooks. I think he did more sprints than anyone in the Premier League this weekend. How pleased are you with where he's at, how he started? Yeah, the game at the end when you play against Liverpool and you play against Bournemouth normally you are going to run. This is what because they will not stop the game. We will not stop the game. It happens also against the Spair sometimes, I don't know, against Newcastle, Brighton, these kind of games that you never know how it's going to finish, but you are going to run and you have to know that the game is going to be like it's going to be and and I think Brooksie has done a very good precision, very good precision. I think the other day probably he wasn't comfortable in the first half because he had like a moment where he couldn't know be as effective, but second half was very good. very good. He finished dead at the end normally because he run a lot and and but the second half I think he not because of the assist. I think we had good combinations with Adrienne with tough around those zones even with Marcos ever going that side and I think we we found good positions. Yes. He also started your first game for Bournemouth two years ago, West Ham. And I wonder because obviously we know what he was coming through at that time. Is are is he a completely different person in terms of form and fitness today as he was when you first arrived? Yes, I think so. I think so. Obviously, there is a part that is the physical side that he's in a much better place. Something very normal, especially in his case. No. But also mentally I think he has he understands very well the what we need from him. You know he's is smart in the way that sometimes he has to work more defensively. Some sometimes he has to cover more the the inside and help the midfielders. Sometimes we allow him to stay higher up the pitch and and just focus more on offensive side and he understands what the team needs and yes I hope we can keep him there and and I think he's in a good place. Yes. And you mentioned Dit earlier playing against Liverpool. How's he reacted to his first taste of Premier League football? I think he was talking to him and he was not surprised but he he saw woof this is this is a high level game you know it's he had already played against Liverpool first season there in the Champions League. So he's used to this kind of of games but the game went really fast that one and obviously he had train with us two days. is there are things we need to improve with him not about him about the the understanding with the teammates how we defend certain certain things and this is not going to be now we are not we've been talking to him putting reviewing things but it's not going to be solved in in one week you know we will have to the same way know I remember when I arrived Sava Milos they make a lot of mistakes at the beginning my first two three months they were playing well but making some mistakes and this you have to sometimes make the mistakes so we can correct and then you can and I hope this process know because it's true that he's more experienced that they were when they come here and I hope it goes quicker but there has to be a process with him definitely and just thinking about Wolves beat up Pereira he goes to the pub with the fans after they win what sort of result in a game or a season would it take at Bournemouth for you to then go down the pub with nobody will notice if I go there nobody will notice to the pub or sometimes I go and I think doesn't have a doesn't have to have also big a perussion about Vtor I think he has done a great job he came in a very difficult moment second part of the season I think from WS was spectacular spectacular and they have been a team defensively very very solid If you see all the stats, all the goals they concede, all the they've been very good. I think they have good defenders, physical defenders, even the games we played against them here. Two two games we had one of the red card was half of the game, let's say, and the other one we we I think we played well, but it was very difficult to score against them. And and and I hope I I hope no, I expect the same tomorrow. No, it's is it's a team that competes well. So, we will going to have to do the same.","[{""text"": ""Good afternoon and um we'll start with"", ""start"": 0.48}, {""text"": ""the the big positive news, the signing"", ""start"": 3.28}, {""text"": ""of Amin Adley that was confirmed by the"", ""start"": 5.12}, {""text"": ""football club yesterday morning.

Man United,2025/26,,9jQPSi-1OKQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jQPSi-1OKQ,2025-08-29,"Good afternoon. Um, after the defeat to Grimby, you made a few comments about something needing to change and the player spoke very loudly of their performance just a few days after. Could you just clarify what you meant by those comments? Um, it's it's I know that when I speak these things, guys, uh, to be really honest with you guys, every time every time that we have or have in the future, um, one defeat like that, I'm going to be like that. I'm going to say the sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players. I I I think I cannot this is my way of doing things and I'm going to be like that and I felt that in the in that moment I was so frustrated and annoying and I know again that you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media to be more constant to be more calm. I'm not going to be like that. So, I'm trying to accept that and I'm going to be who I am and that's why I have the passion that I have. Um, and in that moment I was really upset and really disappointed because I felt that we had a very good preseason. We were playing better. Uh, we were uh being consistent in the way we played. We play badly 30 minutes against Fulham and then that kind of performance I was really disappointed uh with everything but now it's a new game and I'm focused on the next game. >> You also said that you'll have time to think and I appreciate like you said there you were a bit emotional after the Grimby game but you said after Burnley you'll have time to think uh during the international break. I just wonder have are you planning to have some conversations with Jason? No, I have always I I have always conversations with uh with them. I'm just focus on this game and then I need to live this day by day. I I am I'm understanding that and I'm going to be like that all the time. So, prepare yourselves. >> I take what you're saying, but what you said, people then immediately go, well, he could walk away on Monday. It brings an air of uncertainty. Are you aware of that? Do you have to accept that is part of uh part of your emotion that >> yeah yeah you have if you are in one way if you have this kind of behavior you have to understand that that is you have things that is good on on that type of behavior that that that you have the other side of the coin so I understand that and again sometimes I I I I want to quit sometimes I want to be here for 20 years sometimes I I love to be with my player. Sometimes I don't want to be with him. So, um, again, I I need to improve on that. It's going to be hard. Um, but now I'm focusing the next game. >> Just in terms of some of your players, we were told yesterday that there's a deal agreed for Ganacho to go to Chelsea. We think that Raasmus is going to go to Napoli, but we also know that KBBY has said that he wants to leave alone because he doesn't believe that he's going to play many games. Could you just update us on all three of those situations? >> No, until he's official, I cannot say much. Um, I want Suk Kobe to stay. He needs to fight for his place and we need Kobe. So, he's not that is that is not going to change the rest. I I don't know how he's going to to finish. Um I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed, but every everyone has this the the same will have the same opportunity to play. Uh you have to fight during the week. >> Yeah. >> Um Reuben, you said towards the end of last season that um if you felt that the feeling this season was as it was the end of last season, maybe somebody else should take your place. Do you feel that the feeling has changed despite the results? >> I felt that after the game uh I don't feel that now. So it's it's a little bit like that that I think that is the the hardest part of the defeat. Sometimes it's not the result is the way we lost that game or draw that game. That is the the thing that is hard to accept uh because we can do better. is small things, recover position, fight for the ball, running, all these small things. Sometimes we dropped a little bit the level. The good thing is that we now have the next game to put that level up. Um and that is the focus.","[{""text"": ""Good afternoon.

Man United,2025/26,,V9AR9ql1LV8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9AR9ql1LV8,2025-08-22,"Hi everyone. Um, how's the squad looking for Sunday? Is there anybody unavailable back? Is Anana ready to start? >> On is ready to to play like like last week. So, we will see in the in the game who is the is going to be the goalkeeper. Li is out. N is out. The rest of the guys are fit and ready to play. >> Obviously, Sunday's Sunday, sorry, an important match, but there seems to be a lot going on with the deadline getting closer. There seems to be a lot to sort out in terms of outgoings. Is there any movement on that side? Any hope will bring in anything? >> No, you'll have to talk with with Jason. We have a department that is responsible for that part. I'm just focused on on on the performance on Sunday and try to win the game. >> How often do I update you? >> Uh we talk every day. So it's not it's not um it's not a meeting a formal meeting every day but I we are talking about all the situations and uh we are trying to to to see every every situation. Um, we know the players that may leave um or at least we think we do. But does that mean that you think that there may be more people coming in? No, I it's not it's not it's not the um an idea that these guys are going to to leave uh to play in the different club and then we are going to receive another player that we don't know what is going to happen but we um we are not waiting to get to to to to take out someone to to to bring another another player. Uh one thing is not responsible for the other. Does that not make it a bit difficult to plan though if you might do but you might not be? >> No because the the I think the players that you are talking about is the players that are not with the group in this moment. So we have a group training so he's not going to affect a lot >> just on one of those players in terms of Raasmus I just wanted to ask how the conversations have been with him in terms of his involvement whether he was on the bench a few weeks ago and then not involved last week and just how has he taken the news and how has your interactions with him been >> like a professional player so we need to see let's let's wait until the the the market is is closed and then everything is going to be more clear. Can I just ask you about two players who were involved last week and in terms of Luke Shaw and Mason Mount? Two players were injured quite a lot last season. How good has it been to have a full preseason behind them and especially in a World Cup for their own ambitions then being back fit and available? >> More important is for them to help Manchester United to to to to reach our goals and then they are really really very very good players. They are experienced. They play a lot of matches. Mason Mount won the the Champions League. Luke Shaw, I think I already said that when he's when his feet is is really a special player and you can see it uh every time he he played. So, it's it's really important for us um have um these two guys available um for more games. >> Ruben, what are your thoughts on Fulham? Obviously, they're a squad that have had a player turnover this summer as well. What are your thoughts going into this game? I think Fulham is is always hard to to play against Fulham. They have a clear identity. Um Mark Silva is really experienced. He's really smart. He can change several things, cover several spaces and you can see game by game he he he tried to do that. Uh they are really comfortable uh because they have the experience. They they understand the league is long so they will feel confident and and and and relaxed for the game. So it's going to be a tough match. Um, but if you look at the schedule, I look at the schedule and every every game is is really hard to to to play. So, it's going to be a tough match. >> And in terms of what you saw last week from your own team, did that give you confidence? Areas that you want to focus on as well perhaps going forward? What do you see? >> Both both things. I I think we we did well, we play well, but there is a lot of things that we need to improve. We need to understand that every game has it history. The space is not going to be the same. uh the opponent is not going to be the same. Even the responsibility on on the game could be a little bit different and that has a lot of um influence in the game. So we need just to be consistent in in our performance and consistency is not just playing at in the same way is like to maintain the level and not not drop um too much. Uh and I feel that preseason is preseason but even in preseason and Arsenal our consistency was was good. um obviously played on the front foot against Arsenal on Sunday and got a lot of claudits for that when you're playing teams that maybe want to sit back a little bit deeper. I I don't know how Fulhammer are going to play, but do you think that your team have taken a step forward in that regard about how to break down those teams that might just want to let you play and and break them down? >> We are better. I think also because we have different characteristics, we can change that during the game. We have more options. So you see that we play a little bit in the different style with Kuna for example and then in the end with Seesko because he's a different player and we can use that. Um I think we are improving in that department also uh we are creating more chances. So we are ready for any type of game. I think the biggest improvement that we had we uh we we didn't lose the ball so many times in buildup that was really good also for our for our team. So we'll try to be consistent. So trying to maintain the level and try to improve a little bit. >> Well, obviously you say we'll see who starts at the weekend in goal, but regardless of who plays in net, do you feel you need to change how you defend set pieces to counteract what happened last week because teams might target you with those in swinging corners to the goalkeeper? We need to do we need to try to we need to analyze the the opponent and try to put the best the best setup to protect the goal in set pieces and we do it all the time uh the best we uh we can we are not going to change not because of the last the last goal. What we I think we need um to improve is to do the same thing to the opponent to try to take advantage of of that. >> Samuel then Richard with Kobe Mayu. Is there any movement on a new contract for him at all? It's it's been quite quiet on that. >> No. Is with the that part is with with um with Jason. So it's our play. He has a contract. Um I I I don't I don't I didn't hear any news about about that. and and with him and and his development, how how's that how's that going? Because I know you spoke quite highly of him on the tour, but he's he's obviously not started as many games under you where he's had some injury issues. >> Yeah, we play we play he had some issues, but we play with two midfielders and sometimes is a different way of playing. So, we are trying and we have to understand they and they have to understand especially the young the young players that um there is phases in the in the in the in the season. So this is nowadays is is normal with a lot of games things are going to change. Um but he's there he's fighting he's training. So he's one more option for us to to win games. >> Hi Ruben. Um it's a few weeks now since you said those the five players weren't going to go on the preseason tour of the United States. Only Marcus has left. Is it frustrating that you still got the other four? or is there anything that they could have done as players to help sort the situation out for them? >> Oh, I think it's again I know that um is is is not a good thing to have players um in this situation but is clearly that they want to play in the different is in the different club and that is clear uh so we try to to to to arrange everything for both parts to be happy. So I have to to to try to imagine to have the training with the guys that I think are going to be the future and then the other guys are training and preparing for the next chapter. When the window is closed it is a different history. When the window is closed we have to receive the players and then new life and anything can happen.","[{""text"": ""Hi everyone.
