cliche
in and around the football club
getting stuck in
left it all out on the field
caught between two minds
hit the ball a little too well
bit of quality
he can be as good as your
put in a shift
a nice little idea
needs to keep his focus
i fear for him
a dangerous lead
parking the bus
by the scruff of the neck
games coming thick and fast
asking questions of
on an island
left out at sea
chasing shadows out there
two footed player
shooting boots
throw the kitchen sink
criminal defending
rush of blood to the head
fluffed his lines
at the end of the day
one game at a time
a game of two halves
have to take our chances
goal worthy of winning any tie
played a blinder
that hunger
important thing is we got the three points
every game is a cup final
no easy games
advert for the game
play to the whistle
wake-up call
a real eye-opener
schoolboy defending
can score too early
he'll be disappointed with that
in the mixer
got that in his locker
feel he should have done better
be the first to admit that
early doors
body on the line
earned the right to play
gave one hundred and ten percent
the lad's done well
big ask
want that one back
needs to do better there
business end of the season
a results business
a game of fine margins
end product
gone down a bit easy
felt a touch
entitled to go down there
hit that a bit too well
got to hit the target
worked his socks off
second to every ball
make yourself big
stonewall penalty
looked a bit leggy
be disappointed with that one
made it difficult for ourselves
still has a lot to learn
it's a marathon not a sprint
he knows where the goal is
flat-track bully
been immense
no love lost
more than one way to skin a cat
started on the front foot
got the rub of the green
corridor of uncertainty
put himself about
let the game flow
not given the keeper a chance
couldn't miss from there
defending from the front
a wand of a left foot
hit that into next week
having nightmares about that
tried to walk it in
twelfth man
lost the dressing room
must-win game
that kind of player
a massive six-pointer
kept it alive
not over till the final whistle
the table doesnâ€™t lie
given the ref a decision to make
brave as a lion
legs have gone
parked the bus
backs to the wall
all over him like a rash
caught ball watching
got to score from there
ran himself into the ground
a funny old game
lifted the dressing room
got an engine on him
a good honest pro
makes it look easy
put it on a plate
point to prove
what a player he is by the way
a bit of a handful
dead and buried
put it beyond doubt
put the game to bed
what a week he has had
what a season he is having
listen fair play
unfinished business
a bit of a luxury
top drawer
with all due respect
too much respect
that old cliche
it is a cliche
